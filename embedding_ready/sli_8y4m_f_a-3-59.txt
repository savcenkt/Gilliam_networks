I can't remember the first part .
I just remember that they had asked their mom if they could go out to eat .
and then they had scream Mcdonalds .
so they had went to Mcdonalds .
they had order some food .
their mom had forgot the money on the kitchen table .
the boy is waking up .
and he's looking at the time .
he's wasting the milk .
the boy broke his shoestring .
the boy had missed the bus .
and the boy had walk to school .
the alien ship had landed on the grass .
and the door had open .
then the aliens had came out with a dog .
the girl was tryin(g) to go to them .
the brother said no .
the girl was tryin(g) to to pull his hand .
the boy had said no .
I can't think of anymore .
