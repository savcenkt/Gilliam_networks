I can't think .
they went home and got the money .
and they went back to Mcdonalds .
the mom gave him the dollars .
he got up .
and he's poured some milk .
but he spilled .
and he broked his shoelace .
he runned for the bus .
he ask the teacher it's time .
there's an alien puppy and an alien child and a alien mom and an alien dad or alien grandma I think .
I think it's a dad .
and the ship .
the girl was happy to see them .
and the boy was not happy to see them .
the girl took her .
and that was it .
