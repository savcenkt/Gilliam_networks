when they got home the mother told them do you wanna go out to eat .
and they both said Mcdonalds .
so they hoped in the car and went to the nearest Mcdonalds .
and that's all I know .
the boy got out of bed .
he ate some cereal .
he spilled some milk .
his shoelace ripped .
he was late for the bus .
he hadta walk home .
he hadta walk to school .
that's it .
they were playing at a park .
and they saw a spaceship .
and aliens were walking out of it .
and that's it .
