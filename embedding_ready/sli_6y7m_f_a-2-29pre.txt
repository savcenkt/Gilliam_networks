I don't remember the story .
that they went to Mcdonalds .
and her mom didn't have any money .
so +...
and it was at the kitchen table at her house .
a boy was late for school .
he had no time .
he hadta make his cereal .
but he messed it up .
he hadta get dressed .
but he's gotta tie his shoes .
he was late for the school bus .
and the teacher asked him .
there was a hardy ship with those indians .
and the girl wanted to go .
and the boy said no because there was aliens .
and the girl quick pulled off her hand .
and she pulled off his hand and lets go .
the end .
