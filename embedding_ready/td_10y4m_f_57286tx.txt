on tuesday Lisa and Raymond +...
they went to Mcdonalds .
they was happy because their mother said that they was going out to eat .
and when they got there Lisa couldn't make up her mind what she wanted a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
Raymond and their mother both knew what they wanted .
and finally Lisa made up her mind .
Lisa ordered a happy meal with fries coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
Raymond ordered a Big_Mac fries with a large vanilla shake .
their mother ordered a salad .
and the clerk told them that it was twelve ninety nine .
and when their mother reached for her purse she realized it wasn't there .
she realized that she left it at home on the kitchen counter .
once there was a boy named Thomas .
he was sleep .
he heard the clock ring .
but he woke up late .
when he got up he went to the kitchen to make his breakfast and everything went wrong .
he put the cereal in the bowl poured the milk .
and the milk wasted .
then when he put on his clothes he tried to tie his shoes .
but his shoelace had broken .
then when he was walking for the school bus he figured that he would get there early .
but when he got there the school bus had already drove off .
and he gotta school late .
and his teacher said next time get here early .
one day there was a boy and a girl .
their names were Brittany and Jamere .
they went to the park to have the picnic .
and all of the sudden they saw a spaceship land in the middle of the forest .
they ran to the bushes as fast as they could .
and what they saw were a family of octopus .
and they were so afraid except for Brittany .
she wanted to go say hi and touch their pet .
but her brother Jamere wouldn't let her .
he said no no don't go .
and she held onto his hand grabbing him telling him to go forward .
but they never did .
until that day forward Brittany had always remembered that day .
