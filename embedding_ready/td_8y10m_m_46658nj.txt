the two kids got home .
their mom said we're going out .
where do you wanna go ?
the kids said Mcdonalds .
when they gotta Mcdonalds Lisa didn't know what she wanted .
but the boy and their mom already knew what they wanted .
the boy ordered a hamburger fries and a vanilla milkshake .
their mom ordered a salad .
finally Lisa made up her mind .
she said she wanted a happy meal with coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
the clerk said that will be twelve ninety five .
and then when the mom went for her purse it wasn't there .
and she remembered it was on the kitchen table .
one day a boy woke up really late .
and when he poured his milk it spilled out of the bowl .
and then when he was tying his sneakers one of the straps broke off .
and when he gotta the school bus it went without him .
and then when he gotta school he was late .
once upon a time there was two kids .
they were playing in the park .
and then a spaceship went down .
and four aliens came out .
the littlest alien had an alien dog .
and the aliens were creepy looking .
but they were just trying to be friendly .
and the kids ran away .
the end .
