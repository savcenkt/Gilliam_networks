Lisa's mom asked we can eat out tonight .
where do you wanna eat ?
and they shouted out Mcdonalds .
and so the mom and the kids jumped in the car .
and the mom drove them to Mcdonalds .
when they got there Lisa didn't know what to order .
but but the brother and the mom did .
and so the brother ordered a Big_Mac french fries and a large vanilla shake .
and their mom ordered a a salad .
and then Lisa made up her mind .
and she decided she would get a happy meal french fries and a chocolate icecream cone .
and then the clerk said that would be twelve dollars .
and the mom reached for her purse .
but it wasn't there .
she forgot to get it on the table when they left home .
what was the problem ?
a little boy got up for school one morning .
and he didn't +...
he got up really late .
so he rushed downstairs .
and it was eight o'clock .
and he poured the milk into his bowl .
but he was distracted looking at the clock .
and he poured too much .
and it dripped down the table .
then he got dressed .
and he hurried to put his shoes on .
and it snapped .
and then he hadta go and cut the other one to make it even .
so he ran outside .
but the school bus left .
so then he ran all the way to school .
and his teacher put him in detention for being late .
there once was a boy named Michael and a girl named Jenn .
and they were taking a walk .
and then they saw these big aliens .
one had pants and a yellow shirt and a purple jacket .
and another had a purple skirt and a purple top on .
and a little girl had a skirt on with a yellow shirt on .
and the dad was a lab with a little frizzball@c at the end .
and they were coming home from a family reunion because their great great great grandma just died .
and they came home .
and Jenn saw them .
and then Michael said no don't go .
they could be dangerous .
so they went home .
and they told their mom and their dad what they saw .
