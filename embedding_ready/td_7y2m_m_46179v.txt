their mother asked them where they wanna go at dinner .
and they shouted Mcdonalds Mcdonalds .
and they jumped in the car .
and mom drove them to a Mcdonalds restaurant .
and and Tom wanted a cheeseburger with a chocolate shake .
and and the girl wanted a coke and a ice cream cone .
but it cost too much money .
and their mom said oops .
and they left it on the kitchen counter .
and the boy got up in the morning .
and and his clock rang .
and he put his head like this .
and he was tired .
so he poured some cereal and milk .
and he made a spill .
and and he put on his shoe .
but his shoelaces break .
and when he was waiting with his bus his bus passed his house .
so he just went back to bed .
a girl saw some aliens .
so her took the boy's hand and grabbed him .
and and he push away .
and they saw aliens and the alien dog .
