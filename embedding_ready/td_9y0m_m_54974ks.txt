their mother asked Lisa and Raymond where they wanted to eat .
and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
and so they went to Mcdonalds .
and when they walked in they couldn't decide what they wanted .
and Raymond wanted um I forgot +...
but Lisa wanted happy meal coke and chocolate icecream .
and when it came to the total they didn't have their purse .
and that's all .
a boy named Zach got out of bed and was tired .
and he didn't wanna get up .
and he tried to make breakfast .
and he made a mess .
and when he tried to tie his shoe his shoelace broke .
and he got mad .
and when he got his shoelace tied he told his mom goodbye and went outside for the bus .
and it was already driving away .
and he started running towards the bus .
and when he gotta school his teacher was mad because he was late .
a kid saw a spaceship land by the park .
and aliens came out .
and the girl wanted to run towards them .
but the boy stopped her from running .
and the aliens were happy that they were to earth .
and the person in the spaceship was waving goodbye to them .
and that's all I can think of .
