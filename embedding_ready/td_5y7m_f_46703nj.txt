um I can't .
I can't remember .
hm: .
um in what part ?
they wanted to do something but they didn't get to .
they went to Mcdonalds .
the mom didn't have the purse .
at home and when they're in the car .
basically the whole story but not all the words and stuff .
once upon a time there was a boy named Jeffery .
he had big problems .
when he was pouring the milk into his cereal too much came out .
when he was tying his shoe his shoelace broke in half .
and he missed the bus to school .
and he was late for school .
that's his bad luck .
once upon a time a alien ship landed on the planet earth .
two kids one was named rose and the other was named Henry they were going to to have a picnic .
but but a alien ship landed and thought that planet earth was the most beautiful place .
and they stayed there .
but rose wanted to go investigate .
but Henry said no .
but luckily the alien ship came back .
the end .
