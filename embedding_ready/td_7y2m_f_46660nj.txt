there once was two kids that were coming home from school .
and their mother asked them we're going out for dinner tonight .
where do you wanna go ?
and they both screamed at the same time Mcdonalds .
so they hoped in the car .
and when they came into the restaurant Lisa didn't know what to order .
Raymond and their mom knew exactly what they were going to order .
Raymond ordered french fries a cheeseburger and a vanilla milkshake .
their mother ordered salad .
and then finally Lisa decided what she wanted .
she ordered a happy meal a coke and a chocolate icecream .
and the clerk said that would be twelve dollars and fifty cents .
as their mother reached down to get her purse she saw that it wasn't there .
she had left it at home .
one day a little boy got out of bed .
and he was having a really bad day .
when he poured his milk into his cereal bowl it fell all over because he wasn't looking what he was doing .
then when he was tying his shoes to get to school his shoelace broke .
and what he did was he probably unlaced them and walked into school with one laced and one unlaced .
his teacher said what happened to your laces .
and he said it broke .
and so then as soon as he got home he went to get a new pair of shoelaces .
once there was a alien ship that landed in the middle of a picnic spot where two children were about to eat in a park it looks like .
and as soon as the alien family got off the girls wanted to meet them .
and so she was running .
but the boy grabbed her hand because he didn't want her to go .
and then the ship took off .
and the alien family sat down at the only picnic table that was free .
and so they didn't get to go to their picnic .
