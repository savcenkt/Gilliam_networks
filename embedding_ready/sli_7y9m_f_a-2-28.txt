they they wanted to eat at Mcdonalds .
and her mother forgot her wallet .
I think .
a boy got up of bed .
and then he went to breakfast .
he was looking at something else .
he was spilling milk .
then he was tying his shoes .
his shoelaces got off off .
then he he missed the bus .
then he hadta walk to school .
then there was the teacher showing him the time .
once a spaceship was in earth .
and there were two kids that saw the spaceship .
the girl saw alien .
her friends didn't want her to see them because they might hurt her .
because the aliens are not from earth .
they're from another planet .
but they're not from earth .
