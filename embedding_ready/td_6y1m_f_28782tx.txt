she left her purse at home .
she couldn't get her food .
thirty that's all I remember .
once upon a time there was a little boy .
his clock woke him up .
and he hit the clock .
and he thought he was late for school .
so he went in the kitchen made some cereal .
but he spilled the milk a little bit while he was looking at the clock .
then he went to tie his shoe .
but his shoelace broke .
then after that he went to the bus .
but he wasn't ready in time .
then he went to school and said if he was on time with his teacher .
once upon a time there was a little boy and a little girl .
they went on a walk .
and suddenly a plane landed .
and there was octopuses coming out of there .
the boy was scared of it .
he said let's go back home .
no I wanna watch .
then +...
so they kept on watching .
but the boy still was scared of the octopus .
but she wasn't scared of the octopus .
so he pulled her hand to go home .
but she kept watching .
and then they went home .
and they said mom dad we saw a airplane land .
and there was octopuses coming .
they had lots of legs .
this is hard to believe .
let me see .
so they showed them where they found them .
and suddenly they were too late because they already left .
then this +...
there's nothing here .
we did see it dad !
but they didn't see it .
they were too late .
the end .
