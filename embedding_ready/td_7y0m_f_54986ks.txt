Lisa and her brother ?
mom said we're going out to eat .
mom said where do you wanna eat today .
Lisa and her brother screamed Mcdonalds .
and so they got in the car and went to the nearest Mcdonalds .
her brother he said +...
Lisa could not figure out what she wanted .
she said a happy meal or a happy meal &=laughs .
and her brother asked for a cheeseburger french fries and a vanilla milkshake with a coke .
her mother asked for a salad .
Lisa finally made up her decision .
I want a happy meal with french fries and a vanilla icecream cone and a coke .
but when he said how much it cost when Lisa and her brother's mom reached down to get her purse it wasn't there .
she had left it at the kitchen counter .
when Max got out of the bed he didn't feel very good .
when he went to get his milk and his cereal he looked at the time .
when he wasn't looking his milk spilled out of the bowl .
when he was trying to do his shoelace it broke in half .
but when he got outside the bus was already going .
but when he gotta school he was late .
one boy and girl one day went to the park .
they saw a spaceship landing down .
when that door opened they saw a strange family come out .
they could never figure out what they were .
until when they said something they they could tell .
they were aliens .
