their mother asked them that they were going out to eat .
she asked them where they wanted to go out to eat .
they said Mcdonalds .
they jumped in the car .
and their mom drove them to the nearest Mcdonalds .
Lisa couldn't make up her mind whether she wanted to get a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
her mom ordered a salad .
Raymond ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a medium vanilla milkshake .
Lisa finally made up her mind that she wanted a happy meal .
she told the clerk that she would have a happy meal with fries and a strawberry vanilla icecream cone .
the clerk said that it will be twelve dollars and eighty nine cents .
