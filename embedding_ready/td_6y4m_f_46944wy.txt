I think it was one monday monday morning .
after Lisa and Clark got off of school their mother said that they can go out to eat .
and Lisa and Clark said Mcdonalds .
I think it was together or something like that .
then they both hoped into the car .
and they went to Mcdonalds .
and they went into the restaurant .
and Lisa didn't know what to buy .
but Lisa's mom and Clark knew .
so when she gotta the counter she knew .
she ordered a happy meal .
and the mother ordered a salad .
and Clark ordered a Big_Mac with a milkshake .
and then the owner said it would be two fifty five .
and the mother just realized that she didn't have her purse with her .
she left it on the kitchen counter .
one thursday morning a little boy named (5.) Jan got up and made hisself a breakfast .
but he poured too much milk .
and then he was mad .
he changed out of his pajamas .
and put on his shirts .
and it was almost time for school .
so he got on his shoes .
and he was trying to tie his shoes .
but a shoelace snapped .
and then he was really mad .
then he was late for school .
then he tried to catch the bus .
then when he gotta school he was really late .
the end .
one friday morning everyone was having a picnic in the park .
but then in the afternoon they saw a flying saucer climbing down to the ground .
and they were going to set up camp there .
but then all the people ran .
but the girls wanted to see them .
and then the aliens had a cute dog named fluffy .
and he was really cute .
and the little kid told them to be careful .
but they can hold the leash .
and then they were going to stay for ten days .
and then the next day they came back .
and then the aliens changed their mind .
then they went back home .
the end .
