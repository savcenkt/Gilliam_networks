there once was a boy named Robert .
he woke up .
and he said I'm late .
and then on the next picture he was looking at the clock and not paying attention where he was pouring the milk .
so he poured it into the bowl .
but it all splashed out .
and then he was trying to tie his shoe because he was in a rush before the bus would leave .
and he broke a lace so he was mad and miserable .
and then when he was done tying it the bus left already .
and so he hadta walk to school .
and then Robert came in late .
and the teacher said Robert you're late .
