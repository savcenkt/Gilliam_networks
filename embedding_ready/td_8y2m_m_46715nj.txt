when the mom got home on a tuesday night she asked the children that they were gonna go out for dinner that night .
and she asked them where they wanted to go .
and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
and when they got there Raymond ordered a cheeseburger +...
um I forget .
uh what should I say ?
: should I just say that and go on to this one ?
their mother ordered a salad .
and Lisa ordered a chocolate icecream cone .
that's all I remember .
and then the person said that it was twelve dollars and ninety cents .
and the mother reached for her purse .
but it wasn't there .
and then she remembered that she left it on the kitchen counter at the house .
once upon a time there was a boy named Ronald .
and he woke up .
and he looked at his clock .
and he saw that he was gonna be late for school if he didn't get ready fast .
and then he had cereal .
and he accidentally spilled the milk .
and then when he tried to tie his shoes the shoelace broke .
and when he tried to catch the bus it went to school before he could get on it .
and then when he gotta the school the person at the door told him that he was late .
and he hadta get to class .
the end .
once upon a time there were two kids .
and they went off looking somewhere .
and when they came to a clearing they saw a big u_f_o and aliens coming out of it with luggage .
and the little girl wanted to go out and say hi .
but the boy said that she should stay back and tried to get away .
but the girl held on to his wrist and pulled him into the clearing .
and they said hi to the aliens .
and the aliens were scared .
so they went back into the u_f_o .
and they flew away .
the end .
