they went to Mcdonalds .
and they were getting something to eat .
they can't get their food because their mom left the money on the counter at their house .
so they hadta go home and get the money .
that's all I remember .
once there was a boy that got up from bed .
he went to fix his breakfast .
and then he saw he was late .
so he got dressed real fast .
and he broke his shoelace .
he was trying get up before the bus left .
but the bus left without him .
he finally gotta school .
and he was very late .
and the teacher told him that .
he finally gotta school .
and the principal said if he bes late one more time he'll hafta be in detention .
once there were two kids that saw a u_f_o in the sky .
and then they followed it .
they saw a family of aliens that wanted to go on a picnic .
they were going to say hi to the aliens .
but they thought that they were going suck their brains out .
they saw a little girl alien that had a dog that wouldn't stop looking in the trees where they were .
the boy said that they shouldn't go over there because he thought they were going to suck their brains out .
but the girl said I don't think so .
and the girl went up to them and said hi .
and the aliens were chasing them away .
so they ran home told their father father the story .
but the father didn't believe .
so he said I think you need some rest .
so he told the kids to go to bed .
