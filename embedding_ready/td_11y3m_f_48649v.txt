they were in the car .
and the mom asked them where they wanna eat .
and they said Mcdonalds .
and they went up and ordered .
and when the cashier told the mom the money she reached in her purse and realized it wasn't there .
and she forgot it on the kitchen counter .
and that's all I remember .
one morning a boy woke up .
and the alarm clock went off .
he went and poured some milk .
but he spilled it all over the table .
next he went and put on his clothes and tied his shoe .
but his shoestring broke .
then he went to the bus .
but he missed it .
that morning he was late for school .
and his teacher was wondering where he was .
I'm gonna call this the octopus family .
one day they got off this space shuttle and took their dog for a walk .
these two kids Mitchell and Jordan saw octopuses walking .
Michelle looked happy .
but Daniel tried to stop her .
next she tried to go over .
but Daniel still stopped her .
the octopuses looked happy .
um that's all I can think of .
