her brother got a icecream .
and their mom got a salad .
and that would cost fifty cents .
and when her mom looked in her purse it wasn't there .
he woke up .
he poured his milk into the bowl .
and then when he went to tie his shoe his string broke .
and then he missed the bus .
and then his mom took him to school .
