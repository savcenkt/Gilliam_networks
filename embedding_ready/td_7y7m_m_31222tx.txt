on tuesday there were three children .
and their mom asked them where they wanted to go out and eat .
and they all yelled Mcdonalds .
so they drove into the nearest Mcdonalds .
and they went inside the restaurant .
but Lisa didn't know what she wanted to order a happy meal or a hamburger .
but everybody else knew what they wanted to get .
so when they got in Lisa finally made up her mind .
and she said she would take a happy meal a drink fries and a chocolate icecream .
and her mom said she would take a salad .
I forgot the rest of it .
there is a boy named Sam .
and he was in bed xxx .
and he slept too long .
and then whenever he went downstairs for breakfast xxx so he could have breakfast .
(h)e was looking at the clock and spilled the milk and then when he was tying his shoelace got ripped off .
after he tied his shoe he ran outside for the bus .
but he missed the schoolbus .
and and when he made it to school he was late .
once there was two children .
one was named Anna .
and one was named Ben .
they found a path that they never ever seen before .
and they went on it .
but when they made it to the end of the path they've saw a giant alien ship flying down .
and then it landed .
and aliens came out .
and then they yelled .
and Ben yelled .
and he started to run back .
but Anna grabbed them .
and so she could go bring him over to say hi .
but the aliens +...
after they came over the aliens they had a dog .
and the dog barked at them and started chasing them around .
and then they both ran back home and told their dad .
but their dad didn't believe them .
and their dad said that there's no such thing as aliens .
