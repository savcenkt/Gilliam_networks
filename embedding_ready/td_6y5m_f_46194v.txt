when the children got home from school they they asked their mom could they go out at Mcdonalds .
and they went there .
and and then their mom realized that she left her purse at home at the kitchen counter .
when the boy woke up he was really tired because he spilled the milk .
and he pulled the shoelace out .
and people don't do that very often .
and he missed the school bus .
and he didn't come to school on time .
because look at the teacher pointing at her watch .
look at him looking at the clock .
the aliens came down from outer space .
and they walked down .
and the boy was scared .
but the girl wasn't .
they came down with a dad a mom and a little kid and a dog .
and they have eight legs and polka dots .
that's as long as I can think of .
