the boy left his lunchbox .
and the girl just said to him the crash was my lunchbox .
just guessing .
the man waked up .
and she was pouring milk .
it spilled .
then he was tying his shoes .
but it broked .
and then then his dad +...
then he walked to the bus .
but it left .
and he went at a store .
that's 0what my story 0is about .
that girl was running in there .
she wanted to get by that dog .
but the dad grabbed her .
and she said no those are humans .
they're not like us .
and they're like unchopping light .

I don't know what that is .
but those humans had a dog .
but her dog didn't wanna let her pet it .
she was keep running .
then her dad almost fall down .
then they were trying to eat .
then they got back home and go back up .
that's 0what my story 0is about .

I got some more things to do .
before their went up their ate lunch .
then the horse and mans 0were coming .
and the the girl and the boy hide .
