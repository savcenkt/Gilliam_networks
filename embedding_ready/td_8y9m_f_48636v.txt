on tuesday when Lisa and Raymond got home their mother asked them where they wanted to go out to eat .
the kids screamed Mcdonalds .
so they hoped in the car .
their mother drove to the nearest Mcdonalds .
and their mother asked what they wanted to order .
Raymond and their mother already knew what to order .
and as soon as they gotta the counter Lisa remembered to order .
her mother ordered a salad .
Raymond ordered a cheeseburger .
and Lisa ordered a Mcdonalds's happy meal with a soda and a vanilla icecream cone .
and he said that will be twelve dollars and fifty cents .
and her mother forgot her purse .
and that's all I can remember .
and her mother forgot her purse .
I I forgot what .
one morning a boy woke up .
he went into the kitchen to get some cereal .
he spilled the milk .
when he was done he went and got dressed .
when he was tying his shoes a lace snapped in half .
after that he went outside .
he missed the bus .
and he was late for school .
when he got into school his teacher said you're late for school .
I'm gonna hafta give you a tardy slip .
okay .
one morning a boy and a girl were playing outside .
a few minutes later a spaceship came full of aliens .
the aliens came outside and and played for a while .
they ran as fast as they could to see the aliens .
and the boy didn't wanna .
but the girl just dragged him there .
and then an hour later the aliens went .
