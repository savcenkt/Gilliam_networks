they got home from school .
and their mother asked them what do you wanna eat ?
where do you wanna go ?
and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
they hoped in the car .
and they went to the closest Mcdonalds .
and the sister didn't know what to get .
the brother made a order of a cheeseburger and a chocolate milkshake .
and the mother got a salad .
and the sister finally made up her mind .
and she got a kidsmeal .
and then the man said it was seventy five cents .
and the mother she xxx to find her purse .
but she left it at home on the counter .
one day a boy woke up .
and he he went downstairs and made him cereal .
but he spilled the milk everywhere .
then he didn't eat breakfast .
he put on his shoes .
and then he put on his shoes and tried to tie it .
but one string got pulled off .
he was mad .
he thought that he couldn't do anything .
but then he waited for the bus .
and he missed it .
he said come back wait .
but he could not catch up to the bus .
so he walked to school .
the teacher was standing outside .
she said hello what took you so long ?
he said that he had had a bad day .
she said then come in .
the end .

they waved goodbye to the old friends .
and beginned a new house .
they thought it was great .
then after one minute there was two kids .
