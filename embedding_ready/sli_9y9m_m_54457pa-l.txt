they went out to eat at Mcdonalds .
the girl ordered a Happy_Meal with a coke , and fries , and a icecream cone .
the boy order a Big_Mac with fries and a chocolate shake .
and the mom ordered a salad .
the burger cost twelve dollars .
that's all I can remember .
once there been a boy who woked up .
then he got his breakfast .
and he spills some of the milk .
then he broked his shoe .
and so he walked .
and he misses the bus .
so he is late for school .
and the principal says you're late for school again .
and the boy say I never do it again .
there was aliens .
once one girl and a boy that went to the park .
and they saw aliens coming out of the spaceship .
and there were alien people .
there was the mom and a dad and a dog and a kid .
and the dad were carrying a suitcase .
and a boy were carrying the dog .
that's it .
can you think of anything else to put in your story ?
mhm .
there's nothing I can think of .
