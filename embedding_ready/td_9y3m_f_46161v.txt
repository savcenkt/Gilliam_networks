I can't remember the brother's name .
one day Lisa and Tommy came home from school .
and their mother asked where they wanted to eat .
and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
so when they got there Lisa wasn't sure if she should buy a happy meal or a Big_Mac .
Raymond and her mother already knew what they were going to order .
Raymond was going to get a vanilla milkshake and a meal .
and her mother was going to buy a salad .
finally Lisa decided she'd buy a happy meal and a coke and a vanilla icecream cone .
then the cashier said it would be twelve fifty .
when their mother looked for her purse to get the money she noticed it wasn't there .
one day a boy woke up late .
he looked at his alarm clock .
it seemed like it hadn't gone off .
when he tried to make breakfast he still wasn't dressed .
and he had milk everywhere .
when he was dressed and he was tying his shoes his shoelace broke .
then on his way to the bus he was running .
it was a long run .
but finally when he got there the bus had just left .
he followed the bus all the way to school .
when all the kids had already gotten to school the lady was standing outside waiting for him .
she asked him what time it was and what had happened .
one day a girl and a boy were walking through the woods .
then they came to a a clearing .
they saw this big spaceship .
they had no clue what was in it .
then all of a sudden it opened up .
then weird things started to come out of it .
they had no clue what they were .
they wished they had a camera and things with them so they could prove to other people in the town that people from outer space were moving in .
but the boy thought it wasn't a good idea .
but the girl wanted to go meet the new people .
the boy stopped her just in time before the aliens from outer space came to talk to the girl and boy .
