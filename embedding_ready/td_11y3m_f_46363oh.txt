Raymond and his sister +/.
okay .
Raymond and his sister got home from school .
and their mom said that they were gonna go out to eat .
and where would they like to eat ?
Raymond and his sister both shouted Mcdonalds .
so they got in the car .
and they went to Mcdonalds .
and Raymond's sister couldn't figure out what she wanted to eat .
she either wanted a happy meal or a Big_Mac .
but their mother and Raymond knew exactly what they wanted .
Raymond wanted a cheeseburger and a chocolate milkshake .
and their mother wanted a salad .
finally Raymond's sister decided that she wanted a happy meal .
and then the clerk said twelve fifty .
and as the mother reached for her purse it was gone .
oh no look at the time .
I've overslept .
I can't believe it .
I didn't hear my alarm clock .
