and then all of a sudden they saw these people .
and they looked like big octopuses .
so they thought that it was .
and they looked like they were trying to move into here .
and they looked so weird .
so they tried to see what they were going to do and spy on them .
and so they saw them go into this place and just eat their lunch .
and they looked like they were coming on a campout .
so they said hello .
and they ate together .
and when they went back they told their mom and dad what day they had .
and their mom and dad said you guys have wild imaginations .
