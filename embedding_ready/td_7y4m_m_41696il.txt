once there was a boy named Charlie .
and he was late for school .
and when he went to breakfast he poured his milk on the counter instead of the bowl .
and when he went to go tie his shoes his shoelaces broke .
and then when he went outside to go catch the school bus the school bus already drove away .
and when he gotta school his teacher started you're late .
once there was a girl named Emily and a boy named Nathan .
and they were walking in the woods .
and once a spaceship came down .

there were three aliens a mom a dad child and their little dog .
and Emily says let's go look and see them .
and Nathan said no are you nuts .
