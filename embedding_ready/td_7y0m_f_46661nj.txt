once there was two kids .
I can't remember the boy's name .
and the girl's name was Jenna .
and their mother asked where do you wanna go for dinner .
and they both screamed Mcdonalds .
and their mother drive them to Mcdonalds .
and then when they were ordering their mother forgot their purse .
I can't remember the middle part .
so that they could've drived back .
and got their mother's purse and then drived back .
and kind of forgot the rest .
can you put a little bit more details in it ?
okay .
one day there was a boy who his alarm clock woke him up .
and he got scared about it .
and he decided to go to the kitchen and pour some cereal for hisself .
but he realized that time was ten o'clock .
and he was sposta be at school earlier .
so he couldn't eat breakfast .
he hadta rush to his living room put on his shoes and tie xxx .
and when he ran to his busstop he missed the bus .
but but then he hadta walk all the way .
but he was really really really late .
and his teacher was not happy about it .
but then when he told the teacher the truth then that was okay .
and I'm done with my story .
one day there was a mother and a father .
and the mother had friends coming over .
they were aliens .
but their father did not even like them .
but their mother was forcing his father to go .
so the mother told aliens to come in their house .
and the father was all like no no .
and the father started to like them .
and then the aliens just started to move in with them .
and that's the end of my story .
