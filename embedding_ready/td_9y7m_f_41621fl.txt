when the kids got home from school the mom told them they're going to go out to eat tonight .
and the children said where ?
and the mom said at Mcdonalds .
and they gotta Mcdonalds .
Lisa didn't remember what she wanted to eat .
and I forgot the mother's name .
mother and Raymond already knew what they wanted .
but Lisa she wanted to figure out did she want a Big_Mac or a happy meal ?
when they went up to the counter Raymond said he wanted a cheeseburger happy meal with a vanilla milkshake .
and the mom wanted a Big_Mac .
and Lisa finally decided what she wanted .
she wanted a happy meal with a milkshake and a chocolate cone .
and when the man said it will be twelve dollars and fifty cents .
and then when the mom realized she left her purse their purse wasn't there on the counter .
then she remembered she left it at home on the kitchen table .
one day the boy was late for school .
he was such in a rush he spilt his milk .
and his shoe ripped .
so he had probably to tie it .
and he was so late he missed the bus .
and then he was late for school .
one day some kids were playing at the park .
then they saw a weirdest thing come down .
it was a spaceship with aliens in it that wanna come at the park .
and the boy was scared .
but the girl wasn't .
the girl wanted to go meet them .
but the boy didn't wanna .
and when the aliens sitted down and ate their lunch they went back into their spaceship and went off .
