one day Julia and the boy their mother asked them if they were going out to eat .
and she asked them where they wanted to go .
and they said Mcdonalds .
and they jumped into the car .
and the mother drove them to the nearest Mcdonalds .
the problem is Julia couldn't decide what she wanted a kidsmeal or a hamburger .
the boy and his mother knew that they wanted .
the boy told the clerk that he wanted a cheeseburger with a vanilla milkshake with fries .
his mother got a salad .
the clerk told them that the the cost of it would be twelve oh two .
when their mother reached down to get her purse it wasn't there .
one day a boy woke up .
and he was tired .
and he couldn't do anything because he was so tired .
and when he tried to put on his shoe his shoelace ripped .
and he missed the bus .
and when he gotta school he was late .
and he was late for class .
one day there was a girl named Brittney and a boy named Tom .
one day they were out in the woods playing Hide_And_Go_Seek with some of their friends .
suddenly they saw a big ship .
it looked like a ship in the air .
but when it landed they saw millions of weird looking people and a very weird looking dog .
so they ran as quickly as they can and back home through the trail and up the hill .
