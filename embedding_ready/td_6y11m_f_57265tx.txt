on tuesday Lisa came back home .
and their mother said we're gonna eat out for dinner .
where do you wanna go ?
and they said we wanna go to Mcdonalds .
and the children hoped in the car .
and the mother drove there .
and they went to Mcdonalds .
and Lisa didn't know what she wanted .
and the brother knew what he wanted .
and the mother wanted a salad .
and then finally Lisa figured out what she wanted .
and she said that I want a coke a burger and a chocolate icecream .
and the person said it's gonna be twelve dollars and seventy five cents .
and the brother wanted a cheeseburger a vanilla shake and a icecream cone .
and the mother wanted a salad .
and when it was time to pay the mother forgot her purse .
and it was on the kitchen counter at home .
and that's what I can remember .
there's a girl .
and she (8.) liked to have fun and liked to go to school .
and she always woke up early in the morning .
and she put her breakfast together very good .
and she knew how to tie her shoes .
and she was never late for the bus .
and she was never late for school .
there is a father and a girl .
and they like to go on adventures .
and one day they got lost .
and there were some people and pets and things that the girl liked .
but the father told her not to go .
and she kept on pulling the father .
and the girl picked out every little thing that she wanted to take home .
and they went home with all the things that they got .
and when they brought the things in the house .
the house was too full .
and they hadta take some back .
the end .
