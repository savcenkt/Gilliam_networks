Mcdonalds and the kids and the food and the icecream .
that's all I can remember .
they couldn't get in the car ?
well he woke up .
his clock rang .
he made a big mess at the table when he gotta eat breakfast .
he was tying on his shoe .
and the school bus left without him .
so he went to school all by himself without it .
there was some kids .
they were behind the bush .
they saw this yellow thing came down .
and aliens came out of it .
it was so cool .
they went back home and told their mom and dad .
is that the end ?
so they went home and showed their mom and dad for theirself .
is that the end ?
