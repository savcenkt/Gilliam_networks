and the kids yelled Mcdonalds .
and they hoped in their car and drove to Mcdonalds .
Lisa couldn't decide if she wanted a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
when they gotta Mcdonalds Raymond and their mother knew what they wanted .
Raymond ordered a hamburger fries and a vanilla shake .
Lisa +...
their mother ordered a salad .
finally Lisa decided what she wanted .
she chose a happy meal with a coke and chocolate icecream cone .
when the cash register guy said it was twelve fifty their mother reached down to her purse .
it wasn't there .
she remembered that she left it on the kitchen counter .
one day Mac woke up when his alarm went off .
he went downstairs to eat breakfast .
but the milk was too heavy .
and he poured it all over the counter .
he was having a really bad day because his shoelace broke .
and the bus was going away .
when he gotta school his teacher was mad at him because he wasn't on time .
and he felt it .
one day Daniel and Danielle woke up and went to the park .
they saw a flying saucer thing .
when they got there they saw a family coming out .
they looked like a bunch of octopuses .
they had a weird dog and the same clothing as that .
Daniel got scared .
he tried to run away .
but Danielle held his hand .
Danielle said let's go greet them .
and Daniel was older .
and he said no .
Danielle said come on .
so they went to greet them .
and the octopuses talked a different language .
and so did the dog .
it didn't go woof woof .
then why did they have those suitcaseses in the same xxx .
maybe they were the same xxx .
maybe they would think xxx xxx .
when they left they left their dog .
and then they came back down .
and and the dog was still there .
they took the dog and suddenly went away .
Daniel and Danielle were having a good time at the park .
yeah .
