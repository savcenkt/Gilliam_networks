they got happy meals .
and they gotta go to Mcdonalds .
that's all I guess .
when a little boy woke up in the morning he saw his clock .
and rubbed his head .
and he looked up at the clock while he was pouring his milk .
and his milk spilled all over .
and when he was trying to tie his shoe his shoelace went through his pants and then out again .
and then he couldn't get to school +...
he hadta walk to school because the school bus went away without him .
and he was late .
and the teacher pointed to her watch .
there was this kids .
they were looking behind a bush .
and they saw a family of aliens .
and they had a weird looking little girl dog mother and father .
and a plain person because they had lots of feet .
and when the little girl saw them she started to run and pulled her brother's hand .
and they didn't see them .
but her brother said stop .
I think .
and they flew on a little spacethip .
but it didn't look much like one .
it was more of an alien spaceship .
