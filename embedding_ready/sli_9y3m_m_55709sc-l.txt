the mom got home .
and they were going to Mcdonalds .
and the two boys knew what they wanted and the girl didn't .
she didn't know what she wanted .
they went went ahead and told what they wanted .
and it was twelve dollars and fifty cents .
and momma left the money at the house .
and that's the end .
I'm going to call this story Bad_Times .
the boy was waking up one time .
he needed to go and eat breakfast .
he spilled his milk on the floor and on the table .
he went to tie his shoes .
and his lace broke .
and when he was going to get on the bus the bus left him behind .
and he was late at school when he arrived .
Alien_Friends .
there was one boy and one girl .
they were going somewhere .
the alien ship landed on the plane .
and they got off .
and they had eight legs .
and a dog that looked furry .
and that's it .
they went to unload their stuff and take them outside to party and play with the dog .
and the boy didn't wanna do that because he thought the aliens might do something to them .
no .
