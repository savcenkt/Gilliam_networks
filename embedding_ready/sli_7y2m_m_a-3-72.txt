there's a girl and boy .
and I remember the part .
they jump in the car .
and and they went to Mcdonalds .
they order a vanilla milkshake .
they ordered a salad and a cheeseburger with french_fries .
that's it .
this is the first picture second third fourth fifth .
then it's in a single line .
his head hurts .
and it's ten thirty .
he did that .
but he tied his shoe .
but his shoestring is breaked .
and he got ready .
he was tryin(g) to to get on the school bus .
he got in school .
he was running .
that's it .
I just know .
I give up .
there's an alien ship with aliens on earth .
and they're tryin(g) to live there .
the girl and the boy was looking .
they are tryin(g) to get in the ship .
but they they want their whole family to be in there .
so they bring their mom and dad over there and and went on 0the ship and check it out what its look like .
and the aliens just came back and kicked them out_o(f) there .
they just play around the park .
that's it of my story .
