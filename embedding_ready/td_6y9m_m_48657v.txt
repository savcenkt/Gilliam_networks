they didn't know what they wanted .
can't think .
he's having problems .
I can't think .
xxx his head was ringing when the clock ringing .
he had a hard time his breakfast ready .
he had a hard time tying his shoes .
he had a hard time running after his bus .
and he gotta school .
aliens came down from mars .
they had a kid named Ed and a brother and a dog .
and they went to earth .
that's all I remember .
the end .
