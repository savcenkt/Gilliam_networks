they go out to eat on tuesday .
and there wasn't no happy meal .
and mommy just go back home .
and it was there .
he get out of bed .
and he eat breakfast .
and he get ready for school .
and then he missed the bus .
then he go back home to his grandmommy .
there's an alien right over there .
and the kids looked .
and there were aliens .
because she wants to touch them how they feel .
