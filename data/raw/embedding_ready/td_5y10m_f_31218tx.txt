they couldn't get their food &*INV:mhm because their mother left the purse on the kitchen counter .
that was a tough one &*INV:mhm for them I bet .
I remember them screaming Mcdonalds and getting in the car and driving to Mcdonalds .
then they gotta the counter .
then they ordered something .
their mom ordered a salad .
the boy ordered the cheeseburger with fries and a milkshake .
and the mother ordered a salad .
and the little girl ordered a milkshake a chocolate icecream and I think it was fries .
that's all I remember .
one day a little boy woke up .
and his alarm clock woke him up .
and then he had a hard day because he spilled the milk .
and then he broke his shoelace .
and then he'd been late for the school bus .
and the school +...
and he ran as fast as he could to try to get the school bus to stop .
and then he was late for school .
and then his teacher said look what time it is .
once upon a time a boy and a girl went searching .
and they stopped because they saw aliens .
and then the boy got scared .
but the girl didn't .
she wanted to make friends .
and he didn't because he thought they were too scary .
so they went with the girl's idea .
and they went to go meet them .
and then the boy didn't wanna .
so he hid in a bush .
and then once the girl saw their eyes she didn't think they looked very nice .
so she climbed up the tree and hid .
and then the boy named Daniel hid up in the same tree .
and she hid .
well the girl was named Haley .
and she climbed up in the same tree as Daniel did .
and then they ran home told their parents .
but their mother and their father said this is very very hard to believe .
that's the end .
