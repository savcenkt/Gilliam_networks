one day Lisa and Raymond came home from school .
and their mother said we're gonna go out to eat tonight .
and then she said where do you want us to go .
they both yelled Mcdonalds .
they ran into the car .
Lisa was trying to figure out what she wanted to get either a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
when they gotta the counter Raymond told the clerk a cheeseburger fries and a large vanilla shake .
and their mother wanted a salad .
then Lisa made up her mind and wanted a happy meal with a vanilla cone .
and the total was twelve fifty .
then their mother tried to reach for her purse and realized it wasn't there .
and then what should they do ?
one morning this boy Tom woke up .
and he was late for school .
so he went down and went to fix him a bowl of cereal .
but he spilled the milk all over the table .
then when he tried to tie his shoe his string came out of his shoe .
so he put on another pair .
then he went outside to catch the school bus .
but he was too late .
when he gotta school his teacher was very mad at him because he was very late .
one day there was this family at the park .
and they heard this big noise .
they looked up in the air .
and it was just the wind .
they heard it again .
and they looked up in the sky .
and it was a spaceship coming down .
the spaceship opened up .
and four octopuses or aliens came out of the spaceship .
the littlest one had a little spaceship monster .
the parents that were already there they screamed and ran home .
when they got home they realized that they forgot their child .
then they went back to the park and looked for their child .
but their child was gone .
the father said what should we do ?
the mother said I'm not sure .
