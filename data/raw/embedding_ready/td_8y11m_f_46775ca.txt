one day Michael and Jessica were walking through the park .
they saw a u_f_o .
they saw some aliens walking out .
they look like octopus .
Jessica told Michael that she sees human beings with six legs .
and their skin was purple and polka dot .
they had a weird looking dog .
Jessica said that the girl looks so weird .
she looks just like her mother .
and there was another alien octopus walking out .
it was the dad .
Jessica told Michael that the girl's mom is taller than her dad .
Michael got scared of seeing those alien octopus and those freaky looking dog .
so they left the park .
and the u_f_o was still there .
when they went home they told their parents .
their parents didn't believe them .
