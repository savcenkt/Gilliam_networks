I do the story ?
once upon a time there was a ship going to a planet .
and they went down .
and they went out the door .
and these two kids went in the garage and found them .
and the girl was happy .
and the boy was scared .
and they looked at the aliens the whole time .
and and they went at them .
and they went with them .
and they got caught .
but then they were nice .
then they lived happily ever after .
