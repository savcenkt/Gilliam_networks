when Lisa and Raymond got home from school their mom said we're going out for dinner tonight and asked where they wanted to go .
they both yelled Mcdonalds .
so they got in the car .
and the mother drove them to the nearest Mcdonalds .
when they got there Lisa couldn't make up her mind and decide on what she wanted to eat .
both Raymond and the mother knew what they wanted .
Raymond ordered a cheeseburger with french_fries and a vanilla shake .
the mother ordered a salad .
and then Lisa finally made up her mind .
and she ordered a happy meal a coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
and it came out to twelve fifty .
and when the mother went to get her purse it wasn't there .
she realized she had left it on the counter at home .
he is getting out of bed because he's gonna be late for school .
and then he's too busy watching the clock to look at where he is pouring the milk and cereal .
and then he is tying his shoe .
and the shoelace broke off .
and then he goes to catch his bus .
but he misses it .
and then his teacher is mad at him because he's late .
two kids were playing out in the park or field .
and then all of a sudden the spaceship drops down .
and the girl didn't really notice it .
but the guy did .
I don't really wanna go towards there .
he is like stop .
and the whole alien family is walking off the spaceship .
and the little girl is walking a dog .
and the mom's holding her hand .
and the dad's carrying all the luggage .
and then the little boy is coming off the ship like wait for me .
they don't even notice the two kids that were running through the field .
she wants to go see .
but the boy is :m@c not so sure about that .
and the dog is smelling for a new area .
and it looks like a park because of the picnic table and the trees .
