I don't remember that much .
that they were going to Mcdonalds .
and they jumped in the car .
and the wallet wasn't there .
I don't know .
a vanilla icecream cone and a chocolate one and a happy meal .
and their mom got salad .
I don't know .
he's getting out of bed .
he's eating breakfast .
and then tying his shoe .
and running after the bus .
xxx xxx xxx at school .

and two people .
and a dog .
xxx xxx .
she's running towards the aliens .
she's bald .
