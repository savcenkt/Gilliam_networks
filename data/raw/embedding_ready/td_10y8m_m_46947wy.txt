after Lisa and Raymond got home their mother told them that they were gonna go to Mcdonalds .
and when they got there Lisa couldn't figure out what she wanted .
and then Raymond ordered a cheeseburger with a vanilla shake .
their mom ordered a salad .
and Lisa ordered a happy meal with a chocolate icecream cone .
and the clerk said it came to twelve dollars and fifty cents .
and then their mother said oops I left my purse at home .
a little boy woke up in the morning .
and he eat breakfast .
and when he poured the milk it made a mess .
and then the bowl broke .
then when he went to tie his shoes his shoestring ripped in half .
and then right when he was fixing that his bus came .
and it missed him .
and then he walked to school .
and he was late .
there was a little girl and a little boy .
they were playing in the park when suddenly a spaceship landed .
and then they wondered what was in it .
but the little boy was pulling his sister away .
so they don't get caught by the aliens .
and then they walk out and start unloading .
and then they decide that it was nice to stay and play with them .
and it was safe .
and that's the end .
