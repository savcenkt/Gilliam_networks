um I can't remember the first part .
when Lisa and Raymond got home from school their mom said we're going out to eat for dinner tonight .
where would you like to eat ?
Mcdonalds yelled Raymond and Lisa .
so they went to Mcdonalds .
and they ordered something .
but Lisa didn't know what to order .
Raymond and their mom knew what to order .
Raymond ordered a large cheeseburger and a milkshake and fries .
and their mom ordered a salad &=laughs .
and Lisa knew what she wanted now .
she wanted a kidsmeal with coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
and and the waiter said that would be twelve dollars and fifteen cents .
and their mom said okay .
but she forgot her purse on the kitchen counter .
and they went back home .
and they got in the Carline again .
that was a long story .
the end .
the kid +...
the alarm clock rang .
and the kid went ahh@c what's happening .
where am I ?
oh I'm at home .
and when he gotta kitchen to eat breakfast he spilled his milk .
and when he got dressed and was gonna tie his shoes a shoelace broke .
and he missed the school bus .
and he was late for school .
the end .
two kids were in the park .
and they saw some aliens .
so the girl said come on let's go .
and the boy said I don't think that's a good idea .
and the girl said but look they have a cute little dog .
and the boy said I don't think that's a dog .
and the girl said of course it is .
and they had eight legs .
and a weird looking dog and stuff .
and I don't know what planet they're from .
but it looks like they're from mars .
the end .
