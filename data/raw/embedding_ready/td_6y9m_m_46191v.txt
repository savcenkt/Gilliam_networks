I forget the story .
they wanted to go to Mcdonalds .
the mom forgot the money .
there's this boy named jack .
and when he woke up he was late .
and then when he looked at the clock when he was fixing breakfast he put too many milk in his cereal bowl .
and when he was putting on his shoes he broke a shoelace .
then he was late +...
the school bus passed his house .
and then when he gotta school his teacher said you're late jack .
there was two kids named jack and Michelle .
they saw five people having a picnic .
but they really weren't people .
they were aliens .
when they went over there and saw them they knew that they were aliens .
but jack tried to tell Michelle .
but Michelle wouldn't listen .
they really were aliens .
