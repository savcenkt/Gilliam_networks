when Lisa and Raymond came home from school their mom said we're going out to eat where do you wanna go ?
the kids both yelled Mcdonalds .
so they jumped into the car and drove off .
and when they got to Mcdonalds Lisa didn't know what to order .
and the mom and Raymond already knew what they wanted .
when they got up to the counter Raymond said I would like a cheeseburger with fries and a milkshake .
and their mom ordered salad .
and Lisa finally knew what she wanted .
she wanted a happy meal with coke and a milkshake .
that would be twelve dollars and fifty cents said the clerk .
and when the mom went to reach into her purse her purse wasn't there .
one morning a boy woke up .
and he went to the kitchen .
but he was too tired to pour his cereal .
and when he was about to leave the school his shoelace broke .
and when the schoolbus left he was chasing it .
and when he gotta school he got in trouble .
once upon a time way up in space there was a spaceship that went down to earth .
and four aliens came out of the spaceship .
and a girl named Casey and a boy named Tommy saw the aliens .
Casey thought it was cool .
and Tommy didn't .
and Casey was pulling Tommy's arm to bring him over to the aliens .
the aliens looked weird .
they had a lot of legs .
and they had a lot of things .
so Casey said let's go see who they are .
and Tommy didn't wanna go .
and the aliens were happy .
but they came down here to take a person and bring it back up to space .
uhuh .
