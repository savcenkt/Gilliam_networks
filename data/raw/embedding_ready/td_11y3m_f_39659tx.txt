and they said yes .
and she said where .
Mcdonalds they said .
and then the mom got them in the car .
and they left .
when they got there Lisa didn't know what to order .
so she stood in line .
and then when they gotta the counter she figured out what she wanted to order .
her brother Raymond wanted a cheeseburger french_fries and a milkshake .
and Lisa wanted a chocolate milkshake a cheeseburger and french_fries .
and the mom ordered a salad .
and when he he said the total was twelve fifty the mom realized she didn't have her purse .
Nathan realized that he woke up late for school .
and he said oh no and hurried quick to get his cereal .
but he spilled the milk everywhere .
so he couldn't have time to eat it .
and then he tried to get dressed really fast .
but his shoelace poped off .
and then when he was finally there at the busstop he realized his bus had left without him .
and then when he gotta school his teacher was mad at him because he was late .
it was a very bad day .
there were a boy and a girl who were at their parent's company picnic .
they were playing hide-and-go-seek when a girl named Amanda found him .
and while she was dragging him away she noticed that they had ribs at the table .
so she ran as fast as she could not noticing the weird yellow object in the distance .
after she finished her ribs she noticed a funny looking dog walking around .
it had lots of hair on it's body and a little bit on his tail but none on his face .
when the dog started to run away she tried to follow it .
and when she followed it back she found four people who weren't really people .
they looked like octopuses .
and they were carrying luggage .
she didn't know when they were ever gonna leave .
but she decided we're all people .
and she left .
the end .
