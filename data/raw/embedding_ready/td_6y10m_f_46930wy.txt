one day when Raymond and Lisa got home from school their mother said we are going out to eat tonight .
she asked the children where they wanted to eat .
they said Mcdonalds .
Raymond and Lisa jumped in the car .
and their mother drove them to Mcdonalds .
Lisa couldn't make up her mind whether she wanted a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
Raymond and their mother knew what they wanted .
Raymond wanted a cheeseburger and a vanilla shake .
Lisa +...
the mother wanted a salad .
Lisa finally made up her mind .
she wanted a happy meal with a chocolate cone .
the person behind the counter said that will be twelve dollars and fifteen cents .
when the mother reached for her purse it was gone .
she realized that she had left it on the counter at home .
one morning a boy got out of bed .
he was having a bad day .
he went to pour his milk .
but he spilled it .
then he went to tie his shoes .
but he broke his shoelace .
he ran outside and tried to catch the school bus .
but it was already past his street .
when he got to school his teacher said let's go you are late bob .
and you are never late .
but I will let you go this time .
one day a spaceship flew down from the woods .
Jane and bobby stopped to see it .
when everyone came out there was octopuses wearing dresses that looked like people and an octopus dog .
Jane wanted to get closer to see .
but bobby said don't do it .
they will get you .
Jane got closer and closer .
but the family was very friendly .
bobby and Jane said we hafta go home now .
and they went home and told their parents .
their parents said I I wanna meet this family .
so bobby and Jane took their mother and father to the octopus's house and showed them their people .
at first the mother and father were a little bit nervous .
but then they saw that the family was nice .
and they had dinner with the family .
and then they went back home .
