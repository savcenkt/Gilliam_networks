her mom asked her what to eat .
the two sisters said Mcdonalds .
so they drove to Mcdonalds the nearest one .
and they asked them what they wanted .
but I forgot what they wanted &=laughs .
and she forgot her money at at her house .
that's all I remember .
I think I'm gonna call it that he can't tie his shoes .
first he wakes up in the morning knowing that it's school time .
and he's very sleepy .
he doesn't look 0at what he's doing .
he's pouring it in a bowl .
he has the cereal right there .
he's spilling a_lot .
then right here he ties his shoe .
he's looking straight not not at it .
he pulls the shoelace off .
then he misses his bus .
his teacher gets mad at him .
the first thing that happened is when they were walking I think by the park something dropped by .
and it scared the boy .
the girl was happy .
she was running to it .
the ship said something on the top and had stuff gashing through it .
there was a whole bunch of grass .
and there's like I they're aliens .
octopuses they have long how many eight legs ?
one two three four five six seven eight .
they have eight legs .
and the dog has four legs .
the other people they're just walking along .
then she tries to pet the dog .
I think .
it's a sunny hot day .
the octopuses I think are gonna have a picnic .
and the boy's warning her to not go over there .
he's like stop .
that's all .
