they went to Mcdonalds .
and Raymond ordered a happy meal .
and Lisa ordered a happy meal and a chocolate icecream cone .
one day the little boy woke up .
and he found out he was going to miss the bus if he didn't hurry .
and he tried to make his own breakfast but the milk spilled .
and then he got dressed .
but the shoelace came untied .
and it got broken .
but he tied it .
and he he tried to run to the bus .
but he missed the bus .
so he just walked to school .
one day the two kids were playinginging at a park .
they saw saw something strange that was coming from the sky .
they wondered what it was .
and strange looking things came out of the thing that came out of the sky .
the the boy tried to run but but the girl grabbed his hand .
the boy was scared .
but the girl was wondering what it was .
she wasn't scared .
the strange things had a dog that was strange too .
they were purple .
and and they had blue spots .
they had clothes just like them .
and one of them stayed inside and didn't have spots .
and they waved goodbye to the ones that came on .
one of the boys had had spots that were green .
but all of the girls had spots that were blue .
one of the kids had had spots that were blue and green .
green on on his head and blue on his legs .
they went to +...
and the boy carried a bunch of supplies .
the kid walked the dog .
and the grownup girl held the little girl's hand .
it seemed like they didn't know where they they were either .
and they didn't know who the people were .
they only knew who who they were .
and the kids just knew who they were .
