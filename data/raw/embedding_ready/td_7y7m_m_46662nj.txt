their mom asked we're going out to dinner tonight where do you wanna go ?
and they yelled Mcdonalds .
okay kids I think she said .
and Lisa had a hard time deciding .
and then she was trying to decide between a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
then Raymond and Lisa ordered a happy meal with a vanilla shake .
and then she remembered that she wanted a happy meal with a coke and an chocolate icecream .
and their mom wanted a salad .
and then the man said that will be twelve dollars and fifteen cents .
and then her mom went to get the money .
and she remembered that she left her pocketbook on the kitchen counter .
that's all I remember .
what should I call the boy xxx xxx um ?
I'll call him Jeb .
Jeb woke up late in the morning .
he spilled his milk .
he had a really bad day to start .
his shoelace came off .
he missed the bus .
he gotta school .
and her teacher was kinda mad at him .
that's really it .
Lisa and john one one day went to a park having lunch and fun together .
and later in the afternoon an alien invader ship came down and took away their xxx .
