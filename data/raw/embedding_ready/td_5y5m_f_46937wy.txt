when they order their food .
and their mom lost her wallet .
and the icecream .
I love icecream .
hum I don't remember .
he's almost late for school .
and he's trying to pour his milk for for his cereal .
and then his shoetie broke .
and then he missed the bus to school .
and he was late .
the aliens came to earth .
and then the people ran .
and one person didn't because she wanted to see them because they were different .
and she wanted to know about them .
and they were really neat because she wanted to know about them .
and the boy didn't wanna .
and he told them no .
and she didn't listen .
and she should have because the boy was right because aliens are very dangerous .
uhuh .
