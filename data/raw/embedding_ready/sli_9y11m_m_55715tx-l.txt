and then mom wanted a salad .
and then Sara made up her mind .
she wanted a kidsmeal and a chocolate icecream cone .
and the clerk said that would be twelve dollars and fifty cents .
when mom tried to find her purse it wasn't there .
and she didn't have any money .
she had realized she left it on the kitchen counter .

well David woke up one morning .
and he felt bad .
he felt like he was sick .
and his alarm clock was broken .
he went to the kitchen to make his breakfast .
but he spilled everywhere .
and he looked at the clock .
he was already late for school .
then he went to go tie his shoes to run to school .
but when he was tying his shoes his shoelace broke .
and then he went outside .
and he ran for the bus .
the bus had already left .
and then he hadta walk to school .
and then he got in trouble by the teacher .
well there was a little boy and a little girl .
and they were walking down a park .
and they saw a ship came in .
and the octopuses were coming out of it .
they had a family of octopuses .
and the girl tried to run over there and meet them .
but she couldn't because the boy was holding her back .
they seemed nice but they looked kind of weird .
