okay .
there was these two little children .
and their mother said we're going out to eat .
where do you wanna eat ?
and they all shouted Mcdonalds .
so they hoped in the car .
and they went in .
and and Lisa didn't know what she wanted to order .
and then she finally made up her mind .
and and then she said I want a a happy meal with a coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
and then she said how much would that be ?
and it was twelve bucks .
and the mom forgot her her purse on the kitchen counter table .
okay .
this boy woke up .
and he was late for school .
and and then he spilled his milk when he was trying to get the milk from the carton .
and then he went to school late .
the school bus left before he could even get on it .
and then he tripped with his shoelaces .
and then he went to school .
but he was so so late that his teacher was standing in the front door with with the front door open with the cold air coming in .
there was these two little children .
one was a boy .
one was a girl .
and there was this big big park that they wanted to go to .
and they went through the bushes .
and then there was this big big yellow orange spaceship with with a dog a little brother a mom and a dad .
and they went out of the big yellow and orange spaceship .
and the spaceship flew flew .
and there was this big big shadows that no one knew that it was .
and so they looked up .
but nothing saw upon their eyes because it already left .
and then the three little aliens went out to a picnic table to get all their stuff set out .
and then the girl and the boy went out to see .
they just wanted to see if they were real aliens or or not .
the boy said no let's not .
that's a bad idea .
don't you're just being a baby said the other one .
you're just being scared and a baby .
it's just a little peek she said .
and that's the end .
