they went to the Mcdonalds .
they ordered stuff .
and their mom forgot the money .
twenty one I don't remember .
he's having a bad day .
because he got up late spilled his breakfast snap his shoelace and missed the bus was late for school .
not really .
there were aliens .
and the boy was scared to see the aliens .
and the girl wanted to go meet them .
there's a father and a mother two boys and a dog .
their ship landed in a park .
and they all have dots all over their face .
six no not really .
