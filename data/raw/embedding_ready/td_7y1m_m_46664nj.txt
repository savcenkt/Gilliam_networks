I don't remember about xxx .
eight I don't remember about the story .
what happened to the boy and the girl in the story ?
they wanted to get their food .
but they didn't get to have it .
yeah .
once upon a time a boy woke up in his bed .
and then his head was hurting because he bumped his head on a clock .
and after that when he was making breakfast he spilled all of his cereal .
no .
when he was trying to tie his shoes the shoelace broke .
then after that when he missed the school bus he hadta walk to school .
uhhuh .
one day when this girl and his dad were walking to a picnic then they saw this big spaceship .
and there was these aliens coming out of it .
and the daughter was very very upset .
she wanted to go over there and play on the monkeybars and all the things to play .
but his dad didn't want her to because the aliens might catch her .
uh that's how much I can think .
what's next ?
then her dad runs over and grabs her .
and then they run away .
