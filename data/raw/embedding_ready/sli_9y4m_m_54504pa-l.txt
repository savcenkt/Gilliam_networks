when the boy and girl got back from school the mother asked what do you wanna have for dinner ?
and they shouted out Mcdonalds .
so they left the house .
and went to Mcdonalds .
and they went to the counter .
and the person who works there said twelve something .
and and their mother didn't have that much money because she realized that it was on the table .
and and the boy wanted a chicken burger with fries , and a vanilla milkshake .
and the mother wanted a salad .
and the sister wanted a chocolate icecream .
the boy had slept very late .
and he tried to eat his breakfast .
but the milk carton broke .
and all the milk splashed out .
and then when he was trying to tie his shoe his shoe lace broke off .
and when he tried to get the bus the bus went without him because he was very late .
and then when he ran to school the principal said that he's too late .
one morning me and my friend went to the park .
and we saw a big , huge spaceship in the sky .
it landed right where our favorite tree was .
we saw a little girl with seven legs .
and we saw a mother with seven legs too .
and there are more aliens coming out of the spaceship .
it had fancy writing on the top of the spaceship .
and I wanted to see up close .
and my best friend tried to stop me .
and the dog had lots of hair on it look .
and the woman alien raised up her hand like she was saying hi to me .
and we ran back to the house telling our parents .
and they didn't believe us .
then we brought our family to the park .
but the aliens wasn't there or the spaceship .
and our parents didn't believe us at the first moment .
