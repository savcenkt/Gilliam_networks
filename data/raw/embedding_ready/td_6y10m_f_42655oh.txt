I forget it .
they were going to Mcdonalds .
and it cost twelve cents .
the girl ordered a large icecream cone and a happy meal .
and the boy ordered a vanilla shake and a fries and cheeseburger .
and the mom forgot her wallet at home .
once upon a time the boy got out of the bed .
and he poured the cereal .
and he made a big mess .
he broke his shoelace .
and he got late for the bus .
and he was late for school .
once upon a time a alien ship came down .
and the girl and boy ran away .
and the boy said no .
and all the aliens walked out .
and they're gonna have a picnic .
nope .
they were gonna sleep overnight .
mhm .
