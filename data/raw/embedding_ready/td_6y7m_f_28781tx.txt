okay when Lisa and Raymond got home from school the mother said we're going out to eat .
where do you wanna eat .
they said Mcdonalds and jumping up went to Mcdonalds .
their mother and Raymond already knew what they were going to order .
but Lisa didn't .
when they gotta the counter Raymond said I want a cheeseburger cheeseburger and a chocolate shake .
and the mother said a salad .
and Lisa decided what she was going to have .
she said a coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
but .
and the guy said twelve ninety five .
her mother reached to get her purse .
but it wasn't there .
he forgot she left it at home on the kitchen counter .
okay a guy got out of bed .
he realized that it was something .
he went to breakfast .
he accidently spilled his milk all over .
he ripped his shoelace .
he missed the school bus .
he gotta school late .
fifteen and that's it .
once a flying saucer went down from earth .
they went into the park .
and people were scared because they had eight legs .
and they had weird faces .
and their dog was weird too .
and they came from space .
and one girl was trying to see them .
the end .
that's the ending .
