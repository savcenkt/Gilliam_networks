Tom one day got out of his bed .
and he saw what time it was for school .
and he looked at the clock .
and he was late .
so he went to the kitchen and made some breakfast .
and he spilled the milk everywhere .
and after that he went to go get his clothes on .
and his shoelace broke off .
and he was having a hard time .
and by the time he got outside to the bus the bus already left .
so when he gotta school his teacher was mad .

one day Tom and Emmy went to a park with their mom and dad .
and Tom and Emmy saw something in the air .
and it landed on the ground .
and it looked like a spaceship with some weird writing on it .
and some aliens came out with a weird looking dog .
and there was two boys and two girls and a boy dog .
and when they saw them they got scared .
but the little girl Emmy went to go see for herself .
but she tried to bring Tom with her .
but Tom wouldn't come .
and her mom and dad didn't see it all .
and they went back to go tell their mom and dad .
and they didn't believe it either .
so what happened is they went back to show them .
