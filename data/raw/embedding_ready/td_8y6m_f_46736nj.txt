on tuesday Lisa and Raymond +...
I like forgot the whole story .
.
on tuesday tuesday night Lisa and Raymond's mother asked them where do you wanna go out .
and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
so they jumped in the car .
and drove on it .
when they got there Lisa couldn't decide what she wanted happy meal or Big_Mac .
Raymond and his mother knew exactly what they wanted .
: &=sigh I like forget the rest .
mhm .
and then they were done .
is that right ?
I don't I forget it .
and I can't think it up .
mhm .
and I also remembered the ending part .
Lisa got a chocolate icecream cone .
and when they were all done their mother forgot the money at home .
and it was twelve fifty .
and that's all I could remember .
I call it Late_At_School .
once upon a time a kid john woke up very late in the morning .
he went to get some cereal .
and and the milk spilled everywhere on the floor the table and and then the cereal box was well .
then when he was getting on his shoes to go to school the shoelace snapped .
and then he missed the bus for school .
when he gotta school her teacher wondered why he was so late .
then he told her the story .
the end .
one day Daniel and his sister were walking to the park .
and they saw something very strange .
it was a big ship .
the door opened .
and these weird creatures came out .
one was a little kid a mom a dad and a friend and their pet dog .
so Daniel's sister ran over to look at them .
but but when they got there the creatures have disappeared .
where did they go Daniel's sister asked .
well Daniel thought that they were Martians .
and his sister thought that they were just little creatures walking around .
so then they were walking away .
then they saw them again .
how how did they do that Daniel's sister asked .
Daniel said I don't know .
so they went home to tell the story to their mom and dad .
the end .
