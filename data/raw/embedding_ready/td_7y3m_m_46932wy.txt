one tuesday uh I kind of forgot that whole stairy story .
they jumped up and said Mcdonalds .
once there was a boy .
he woke up by the alarm clock .
then he turned it off .
when he was getting cereal he poured milk all over the place .
when he was going to eat breakfast +...
then when he was going to tie his shoe his shoelace broke .
and the bus left before him .
and the teacher said you're late !
once there was a big huge round thing on the ground .
and then people are looking .
a girl named Rachel saw some aliens come out and an alien dog with no eyes .
this boy named bob he was scared .
no oh duh .
the end .
