when they got out of school they both said that they wanted Mcdonalds .
when they got there the girl couldn't decide what she wanted .
and the boy and the mom knew what they wanted .
and then when they gotta the front desk +...
and when they all told them how much it was +...
and mom forgot her purse .
the boy ordered a Big_Mac .
and then the girl ordered a happy meal .
and that is all I can remember .
first of all he's waking up from his bed .
and then he is eating his breakfast .
but he is making a big mess .
and then he is tying his shoe .
but his shoestring broke .
and he missed the bus .
and then he's late for school .
that's all .
it's a spaceship .
and these aliens with lots of legs are walking off .
and there is a dog .
and the boy is stopping the girl from probably going over there and touching them or something .
and (5.) that's all .
um might say something up there .
um that is all I can think of right now .
