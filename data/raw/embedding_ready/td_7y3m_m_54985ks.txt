when they gotta the counter Raymond ordered a cheeseburger .
and his mother ordered a salad .
then Lisa finally made up her mind .
she said that she wanted a happy meal .
and the man at the counter said that it costed twelve dollars and fifty cents .
and when her mom reached for her purse it wasn't there .
she forgot she had left on the counter at home .
