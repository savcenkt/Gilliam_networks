and they were going to have a picnic .
but then when they saw that a flying saucer was there they were afraid there were aliens .
and they saw big octopuses with hands .
and they thought they were aliens .
and they even have a a alien dog too .
and they thought they wanted to rule the world .
and so Rachelle wanted to get the little alien .

Rachelle wanted to have proof .
