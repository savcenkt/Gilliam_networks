when Richard and Sally got home their mom said where do you wanna eat out ?
they said Mcdonalds .
they hoped in the car .
and their mom drove them .
they got there .
Sally couldn't make up her mind .
and Richard ordered a cheeseburger with fries .
the guy at the cash register said that will be twelve dollars .
she reached down .
and she remembered she left her purse on the counter at home .
one day a kid woke up because of his alarm clock .
and he looked at it .
and it was almost eight o'clock .
when he was pouring his cereal he looked at the clock to see what time it was .
and milk overflowed .
and when he was walking to school his shoelace snapped .
and he was angry .
and he tried to run up to the bus and catch it .
but he missed it .
and when he gotta school the teacher said you are late .
one day Sarah and Dane were walking in the forest .
and they heard something .
and they looked over the bush .

and they wanted to have a picnic .
and they wanted to spend the night a little while .
and they had a pet .
and then Sarah tried to go look out to go look at aliens close up .
and Dane thought thought it was not a good idea .
then when they left Sarah said oh_man wish we had the chance to get proof .
the end .
