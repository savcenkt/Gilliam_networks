and the mother and Raymond knew what they wanted to eat .
and the little girl decided for a kidsmeal .
and the mother had a salad .
and the mother forgot her purse on the the kitchen counter at home .
there was this little boy that woke up .
and it looks like he was worried that he would probably be late for school .
or he would probably miss his bus .
and he spilled the milk .
and he broke his shoelace .
he missed the bus .
and he gotta school .
his teacher was probably mad at him .
and when he broke his shoelace he looked pretty mad .
and when he missed the bus it looks like he started running .
and he looks exhausted when his teacher looks like she's mad at him .
and he looks sort of mad because he is late from waking up .
and he is probably sorry that he spilled the milk .
and he is mad because he broke his shoelace .
and he is probably running after the bus .
and his teacher looks mad at him because she has a little frown .
once upon a time there was two children that were walking in the bush .
they saw a spaceship land .
and the little girl got really excited .
and there were aliens walking out of it and an alien dog .
and the little girl wanted to go and talk to them .

and she grabbed his wrist .
and the little boy was going like this and trying to stay there .
but the little girl pulled him out .
and the aliens heard the little kids .
and they took them to space .
and they dropped them out of the spaceship .
and they got hurt .
