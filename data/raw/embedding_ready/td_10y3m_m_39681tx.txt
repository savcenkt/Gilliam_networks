they went to Mcdonalds .
and their mother forgot her purse .
that's pretty hard .
but it's hard .
what do you mean by when the things occurred ?
well the boy and the girl wanted to go to Mcdonalds at the beginning .
and actually at the beginning the mother said where do you wanna go out to eat ?
and the boy and the girl said Mcdonalds .
they both said .
and then after that they went off in the car to go to Mcdonalds .
and once they arrived there everybody ordered something .
and then the mom reached for the purse .
and she figured out that her purse was at home .
okay first I was getting up from bed .
and I figured out that it was time to go to school .
so I went into the kitchen .
and then I made a big mess out of the milk and everything else .
and I was just looking at the time .
and so after that I was very frustrated .
so I broke my lace on my shoe .
and then once I got outside the bus is already left .
and so I hadta walk to school .
and I didn't make it to school on time .
once upon a time there were a boy and girl .
they were both brother and sisters .
they were trying to go down to the park for a family picnic .
but once they got there they saw an alien spaceship .
so they saw a dog alien a little boy alien a mom and a dad alien and a sister alien .
and then her brother said don't go don't go because those are aliens .
you don't know what they can do .
but she wanted to go .
so she said come on come on .
it's time to go .
we gotta go look .
and so at the end the brother won .
and they went back to go tell their parents .
and then they came back and saw the aliens .
and then they believed them .
and then the parents fainted .
and once they awoke they went back home and called the police .
and asked them to get these aliens off the park .
and then once the police came they saw nothing .
that's it .
