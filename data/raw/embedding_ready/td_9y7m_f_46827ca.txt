on tuesday the the kids came home .
and the mom said where would you like to go eat ?
and and the kids yelled at Mcdonalds .
and so the mom drove to Mcdonalds .
and Raymond ordered cheeseburger fries and a vanilla milkshake .
and Lisa couldn't decide which order to a happy meal or a Big_Mac .
and so she finally decided .
and she said I want a happy meal coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
and the mom said she would like a salad .
and that all cost twelve dollars .
so when the mom reached to her purse the twelve dollars wasn't there .
so so she left it on the kitchen counter .
once a boy he just got up to go to school .
and his alarm clock rang .
and then he spilled his milk when he was tryin(g) to eat cereal .
then when he went to go tie his shoes his lace broke .
he got out of the house .
and then his mom said be good at school .
and then he walked to the busstop .
and then the bus left without him .
and all the kids ran into the school .
and then the bell rang .
and then it was at two hours later .
and the little boy came .
and the teacher said you are too late .
you go to detention .
once there was a boy and a girl .
and they they were behind a bush .
an alien ship came down .
and then the dog started barking .
and then the aliens knew that there was people looking at them .
and so they got the girl .
and they took her to the spaceship .
another day later the parents put signs up .
and then the last time the boy went on the spaceship with them .
and then when they came out first they started to look weird and then weirder and then the weirderest@c .
and then their mom said go back with the aliens .
and the dog went with the parents .
and then those parents took care of it .
&=laughs and then they lived happily ever after .
