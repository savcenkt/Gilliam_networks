tuesday tuesday night Lisa and Raymond +...
I don't remember how the first part started .
they went to Mcdonalds .
and they ordered stuff .
but their mama left her purse on the kitchen counter .
and they went home .
one morning when mike got up he fixed hisself a bowl of cereal .
but he spilt the milk .
can I start over ?
one morning as mike woked up he went downstairs to fix hisself a bowl of cereal .
he spilt the milk because he was having a bad day .
when he tries to go to school he missed the bus .
his shoes were untied .
and he fell .
when he finally reached school he was late .
and (6.) he just went to class .
this story is called The_Alien_Family .
one afternoon Michael and Lisa were running through the park .
they saw a big spaceship .
they couldn't believe their eyes .
but when the people got out Michael and Lisa ran .
they said that it was aliens .
they couldn't believe it .
so they ran back home to get their mom and dad .
and the family went through the park to find the aliens .
the aliens spoke .
but Michael and Lisa didn't know what they were saying .
so they just made friends and lived happily ever after .
