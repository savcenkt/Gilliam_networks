on tuesday um (5.) oh gosh (10.) +...
they went to Mcdonalds with their mom .
and they ordered theirself .
and it was twelve fifty .
and then their mom figured out she had left some purse on the counter in her house .
so they couldn't buy anything until she got it back .
a boy named bill woke up one morning and saw his clock and said he was late for school .
so he didn't get dressed .
so he went to the kitchen first and poured his milk all over the counter because he wasn't paying attention .
then he went back to his &=sighs room and put on his clothes .
and he broke his shoelace .
and he hadta go to school with a broken shoelace .
he ran outside grabbed his bookbag and ran outside .
then he saw that he had missed the bus from his bus stop .
he could see it way down there .
so he tried to wave and stop it .
but it wouldn't stop .
when he gotta school the teacher looked at him weirdly .
his hair was messed up .
he was out of breath .
and his teacher just couldn't think of what had happened to him that day .
one day there was two kids Jessica and bill .
they were walking down a trail until they came to a bush .
and Jessica looked through the bush and saw a big flying saucer .
it landed on the ground and out came a family of aliens .
the mother had the little child .
and the child had the dog .
and the father was carrying all the bags .
Jessica and bill wondered why they came here .
and Jessica wanted to go see them and talk to them .
but bill said no because they were aliens and not everything could happen .
and as they walked out of the saucer somebody waved goodbye and closed the back .
then they took their dog on a walk to the park .
and that's when Jessica finally found out that they didn't have a home .
so they tried to find a home for them .
but they couldn't .
so they just lived outside for the rest .
and nobody knew but Jessica and bill .
