I forgot .
Mcdonalds .
they ordered their food and when their mother tried to get the money it wasn't there .
I don't know what to say .
he got out of bed .
and he went to get his cereal .
and he spilled the milk .
he tried to tie his shoe .
his shoelace came off .
he missed his bus .
and he was late for school .
there was people going in this alien world .
aliens coming off the spaceship .
