their mom ate a salad .
and the little boy ordered some french fries and some nuggets .
and and the little girl wanted a snowcone .
and I forgot .
then boy got up .
he spilled the milk .
then his shoe came loose .
and it went through his pants .
and the bus left without him .
and he walked past a lady with grey hair .
I'm finished .
there was two people .
and there was a big spaceship .
and smoke was coming out of it .
and the four aliens came out .
they had clothes on .
and their dad had a purse xxx xxx and a dog that has a lot of hair .
and that little girl wanted to go see .
and there she had xxx and this table .
and here's some trees .
finished .
