their mother said we're going out to eat tonight .
mother asked her children what do they wanna eat ?
they said Mcdonalds Mcdonalds .
so they all jumped in the car and went to Mcdonalds .
&=sighs they went inside and &*INV:mhm Lisa didn't know what she wanted to order .
and &=sighs forgetting the son's name .
his mother ordered a salad .
the son he ordered a burger fries and a chocolate shake .
and Lisa she ordered a burger and a banana icecream cone .
she ordered a drink too fries .
but the mother left her purse on the kitchen counter .
his alarm clock woke him up .
he went in the kitchen to make breakfast .
he spilled milk all over the table .
when he tried to put on his shoes and tie them he couldn't .
then when he went outside to go to the bus he missed the bus .
so he gotta school late .
a alien ship came and parked right there .
alien people came out of the ship with a little dog and mother son and father carrying a lot of bags .
her sister pulled his brother hand .
and his brother said no .
and his sister went over to say hi .
so they played and played all night .
that's the best I can do .
