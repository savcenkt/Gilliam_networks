one tuesday after school Lisa and Raymond were in the car .
when they got home her mother said we're going out to dinner tonight .
where do you wanna eat ?
they both yelled Mcdonalds .
they hoped in the car .
when they they talked about what they were gonna get .
but Lisa wasn't sure what she wanted .
when they got there they told their order .
Raymond ordered a double cheeseburger with a vanilla shake and fries .
her mother ordered a salad .
Lisa finally made a decision .
she was gonna get a happy meal with coke and chocolate shake .
the clerk said that will cost twelve dollars and sixty eight cents .
her mother reached down to get her purse .
and she realized it wasn't there .
then she remembered she left it on the counter at home .
what should she do ?
on tuesday morning Tim's alarm clock didn't go off .
and he woke up suddenly .
so he went downstairs and was about to eat breakfast when he spilled the milk when he was looking at the clock .
then he decided that he shouldn't have breakfast .
so he rushed into the tv room and tried to tie his shoes .
but his lace broke .
so he got his backpack on and ran outside .
but the school bus left .
so he just walked to school and told his teacher what happened .
one friday after school (6.) bill and Rachel went to the park to play .
they were having a fun game until they heard a strange sound .
they looked up in the sky and saw a flying saucer .
they both screamed .
the flying saucer came down .
and a family of aliens came .
they were very scared .
so they ran to their parent's house and told them about it .
the parents did not believe them but followed them .
when they got there they couldn't see anything .
the parents said don't ever lie like that again .
and the flying saucer was never seen again .
