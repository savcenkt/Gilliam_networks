mom said they are going to go out to eat tonight .
and she asked them where they were going to go .
and they shouted Mcdonalds .
and they got in the car and went to Mcdonalds .
when they got inside the restaurant Lisa can't make up her mind .
does she want a kidsmeal or a Big_Mac ?
but mom and somebody already knew what they want .
somebody wanted a cheeseburger with french fries and vanilla milkshake .
but when mom tried to get her purse it wasn't there .
now she remembered .
she put it on the kitchen table .
when I got up from bed I tried to pour some milk into my cereal .
but it spilled .
I tried to tie my shoe .
but it broke .
so I I missed the bus .
and I was late for school .
once upon a time there was a family .
they saw some aliens .
but the aliens +...
but their dad said don't go near them .
but the mom said I wanna meet them .
but she couldn't .
but the aliens aliens said hi friends .
and then they walked off and found a home .
the end .
