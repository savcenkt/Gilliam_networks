when when they both got back from home their mother asked what do you wanna go out ?
and they said Mcdonalds .
so they got in the car .
and they drove to the nearest Mcdonalds that they could find .
then they told what they wanted .
but the problem was that the mother can't find her wallet .
once there was a boy .
he went to school .
but his alarm clock banged his head .
xxx .
the alarm clock ringed .
and he bumped his head on the ceiling .
and then he was too busy looking at the clock .
and he forgot about the milk and the cereal .
and then he was in a rush and tieing his shoe .
but it broke .
so he ran there .
and he went to the bus but it missed .
and the teacher said that you are late for school .
once there was two people walking to the park , a boy and a girl .
when they were walking a ship came down and landed .
and it opened .
and they were right behind the bush because they were scared .
and the girl wanted to go away and say hi to them .
but he was too scared to ask .
then when they looked at them they got on the ship .
and they ran .
and they were aliens .
and then they just xxx .
maybe they might just take a picture of them .
and maybe then they tell their parents about it ?
