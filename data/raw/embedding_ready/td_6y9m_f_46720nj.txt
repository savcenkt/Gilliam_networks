Lisa and Raymond came home from school .
and their mother asked where do you wanna eat .
and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
and so they went to Mcdonalds .
and Raymond and his mom knew what they wanted .
and so so Lisa started to think .
and she wanted a happy meal .
and so the mom got a salad .
Raymond got a milkshake .
and Lisa got a happy meal .
and then when it was time to pay the mom left her money at home .
so that's it .
.
there was a boy .
and he got out of bed .
and his alarm clock was late .
so he saw the alarm clock .
and he thought I'm late for school .
and so he got out of bed .
and he tried to pour his cereal .
but he was really quick and in a really bad rush .
and so when he was trying to tie his shoe also one of the laces broke off .
and so when he saw the school bus come it just left .
so he was running for it as quick as he could .
and he gotta school in time .
there were two kids .
and they were playing on a playground .
and they saw a spaceship landing from another planet .
there came octopuses coming out .
and a weird dog .
and so the girl was trying to run to them to see who they were .
and the boy said stop stop .
something bad might happen to you .
the girl's name was Sara .
and the boy's name was Joseph .
and so when they saw the weird people coming they were a little scared .
the boy was a little scared except for the girl .
that's my story .
