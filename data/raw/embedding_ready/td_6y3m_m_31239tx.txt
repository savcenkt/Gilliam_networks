one night when they came home from school their mother told them they're going somewhere to eat .
they both yelled Mcdonalds .
so they drove to the nearest Mcdonalds .
when Lisa got there she did not know what to order .
uh what's the boy's name again ?
I forgot .
the boy and their mother knew what they were gonna have .
Lisa finally made up her mind .
she said I want a happy meal a coke and a chocolate icecream .
is that cool ?
is that good ?
their mother forgot her purse .
yeah .
one day a boy went to school .
he had problems .
he overfilled his bowl .
he broke his shoelace .
and he was late for the school bus .
and the teacher was waiting outside the door .
one day some kids were walking in the woods .
the kids' names were Daniel and Fred .
a strange thing came by that looked like a flying boat .
but it had weird markings on it .
and some aliens came out .
and the aliens' pet was fly xxx .
the end .
