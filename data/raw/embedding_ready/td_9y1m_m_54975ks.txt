Raymond and Rita their mom already knew what they wanted to order .
Raymond wanted a cheeseburger with vanilla shake .
and their mother ordered ordered a salad .
Lisa finally made up her mind and ordered a happy meal a chocolate icecream cone and a large coke .

when he got dressed his shoelaces fell out .
he was very mad .
then he missed the bus to school .
he hadta walk to school because it took a very long time .
the teacher scolded him for being late .
and he got a tardy slip .

Daniel and Mary were playing in the park .
and they saw this giant yellow sphere shaped thing come down .
they hid behind the bush .
then it opened .
it had strange markings all over it .
then weird people came out of it .
they looked like aliens because they were aliens .
they didn't look exactly like us but they wore the same clothes and had a dog .
they had purple spots all over them .
they were astonished .
Mary wanted to touch them and wanted to take Daniel with her .
but Daniel didn't wanna go .
so they just stared and stared and stared .
and they divided into two and kept on dividing until they controled the world .
and all the people died in the world .
the end .
