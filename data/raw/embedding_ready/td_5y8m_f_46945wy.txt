what's the girls name again ?
Sally .
eight I think I forgot the story .
the girl didn't know what she wanted .
so +...
and the boy knew what he wanted .
and the mom forgot her money .
twenty one I'm ready .
boy woke up .
he poured his milk in his cereal .
he started to get miserable .
when he got dressed he started to tie his shoe .
he broke his shoelace while he was starting to tie .
he got angry .
the bus started to drive away .
he got even angrier .
the teacher said you're late .
once kids were walking .
they went to the park .
when they got there her friend got scared .
she was happy .
everything and everyone turned into a alien .
I think I'm done with that .
