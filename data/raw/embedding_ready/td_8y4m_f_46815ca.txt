tuesday night a mother called his childrens .
um I forgot .
they wanted to go to Mcdonalds .
and and they hop on the car .
and then they drive over .
and Lisa didn't know what to pick .
so the boy and the mom know what to pick .
the boy pick a cheeseburger some fries and a large vanilla shake .
her mom picked some salad .
and Lisa know what she wanted to pick a happy meal some fries and a coke and a icecream cone .
and the the guy said that that will be twelve dollars and fifty cents .
and the mom didn't have the money .
so that's all .
once upon a time there was a little boy .
and he hits his head on his pillow on there .
he was looking at the clock .
he was xxx and some cereal .
and he spilled the milk .
and then he didn't know how to tie his shoe .
and then he missed the bus .
and then the teacher said you you are late for school .
and he was looking at her .
that's all .
the end .
once upon a time there were a space that came down to earth .
and inside there were aliens that looked like octopus .
and the woman hold the man hands and took them over here .
but the man say stop stop !
those are dangerous .
they could take your brain off .
the end .
