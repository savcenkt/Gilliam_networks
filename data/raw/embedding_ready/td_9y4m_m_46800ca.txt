one day Raymond and Lisa came home .
and then their mom said we're going out to a restaurant tonight .
what place do you wanna go to ?
and they both yelled Mcdonalds .
so when they're there their mom says what do you wanna order Lisa ?
then Raymond said a cheeseburger a drink and a vanilla sundae .
and then her mom said what do you wanna order Lisa ?
and Lisa said a happy meal and a drink and a chocolate shake .
and then the clerk said it would be twelve fifty .
so then their mom reached down to get her purse .
but then it was not there .
and she just remembered that it was back on the kitchen counter .
this boy wakes up .
and he pours milk inside his bowl .
but he spills a lot .
and when he was going to school he tripped .
his shoes got untied .
and then he went down to tie it .
but then he got frustrated .
and then he snapped part of it .
and then when he was going to the school bus the school bus left because he was late .
so then he hadta walk to school .
and when he was at school he got a tardy .
and he was late .
okay .
um I don't really know any names .
Michelle and Daniel .
I mean okay .
they were walking in the park when they heard the loud noise .
and they looked up in the air .
and they saw a large thing up in the air .
and then they saw it was a u_f_o .
and then the u_f_o came down .
and then they saw aliens .
and then Michelle wanted to go say hi to the aliens and stuff .
but then Daniel said no .
so then they hid behind a bush .
the aliens were having a picnic .
and then when the aliens went back inside their ship and left they ran out .
and they were all amazed what happened .
so then they went to other people and saying what they saw .
but they never believed them .
so then they just went home .
and they tried to tell their mom .
but then their mom and dad didn't believe it .
so they just went back to bed .
yeah .
well then at night Daniel and Michelle saw a large light that went through the sky .
and they probably thought it was a u_f_o again .
