Lisa and Raymond got back from school .
and their mother asked them where do you guys wanna go out to eat ?
Raymond and Lisa shouted out Mcdonalds .
they jumped in the car and went to Mcdonalds .
and Lisa bought a kidsmeal .
and Raymond bought a cheeseburger with +...
and their mom bought a salad .
and that's all I can remember .
Denver woked up .
and he looked at his clock .
and he got dressed .
he went downstairs .
he poured himself a bowl of cereal .
and he tied his shoe .
and he missed the bus .
and he walked to school .
the spaceship dropped .
and the the aliens comed out .
and they took their dog .
and it looks like somebody's waving back to them .
and she's waving to them .
and the boy's holding her back .
and she's trying to run .
that's all .
