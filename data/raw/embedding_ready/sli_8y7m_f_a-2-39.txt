on thursday they wanted to go to Mcdonalds .
and they couldn't figure out what they were gonna order .
the boy and his mom they said that they knew what they wanted to eat .
Lisa couldn't figure out what he wanted .
I mean Lisa she didn't figure out what she wanted .
and then she figured out what she wanted .
then their mom forgot that she left her purse at home .
one day the boy woke up .
and he was so hot when his alarm clock went off .
he went and got a bowl .
then when he poured the the milk it spilled over .
when he tied his shoe he wasn't watching where he was tying his shoe .
then he was taking so long to tie his shoe the bus left .
then his mom hadta take him .
there was this alien ship .
and then the aliens came out .
the girl she was going .
but her brother was grabbing her and saying no .
and and then the alien stayed in because the alien family went to go to another house .
then the alien ship left and went to find a new home .
but they couldn't find any .
and then finally they found one .
but it wasn't all the way built .
so they 0had been waiting for days and days .
and then it was built .
but they they were trying to find a mattress to sleep on a bed .
and there was no stuff .
so they just slept on the floor .
and and then they went to the store and bought a pillow and a blanket and a mattress so they could sleep on it .
then this monster came and destroyed their house .
then they hadta go and find a new house .
but there was no other new houses .
so they hadta go live up in the alien that they lived in before they they were finding a new house .
and then that's all .
