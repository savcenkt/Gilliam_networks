on thursday something they went to Mcdonalds .
the mom ordered lettuce .
and she lefted the her purse at home .
that's all I remember .
first he gets out of bed .
and he's late .
and then he's pouring milk .
and it dripping off the table .
and he's late .
and then he tried to tie his shoe .
but his his shoelace got off of his shoe right here .
and then he missed the school bus .
and then he's late for school .
once upon a time there was two kids .
they went in the park .
and a spaceship land there .
there was aliens coming out .
one was a big alien sister .
one was a big alien dad .
and one was a a mom alien .
and one was a little girl alien .
and there was a dog alien .
the the girl wanted to go and play with them .
but the boy +...
and she grabbed onto the boy's hand .
but the boy didn't wanna go .
he was too afraid they would do something bad to them .
the end .
