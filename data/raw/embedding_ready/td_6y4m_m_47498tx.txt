on tuesday Danny and I don't remember the girl's name +...
they shouted Mcdonalds when they went out to eat not at night .
and Danny ordered some cheeseburger french fries and a big icecream cone .
and the sister ordered a chocolate icecream cone .
and they didn't have their money .
and is that it ?
when uh what's his name ?
oh Samantha ?
I'll call her Samantha .
when Samantha got up out of bed it was time to wake up .
and then when he got in the kitchen he fixed some cereal .
and then he poured a lot of milk in there .
and it wasted .
and then when he started to get up and finish eat breakfast he got up .
he sat down .
he tied his shoe .
but one of his shoelace broke .
and then when he got up he wanted to ride on the school bus .
and then he hadta walk to school .
the end .
soon when the wife and the dad went through the woods they saw a ship .
though it looks like a alien ship .
and they saw some aliens and a alien dog .
they walked over on the grass .
and they talked .
and then they said look there's a table we can eat at .
and then they sat at the table .
they ate .
and then they drove off .
and then when they were ready to go the ship came back .
the end .
