when the children got back from from school their mother said we are going to go out to dinner tonight .
and they screamed ahhh@c !
they screameded I wanna go to Mcdonalds !
and they went .
and they they ordered a chicken burger and a large chocolate icecream .
and that's all I remember .
and then they left .
and her mommy went to go get them her purse .
she said I left it on the kitchen counter .
that's all I remember .
she woke up .
and and she got dressed .
and she she put on her shoes .
and she tied her tie laces .
but it broke .
next morning when she woke up she was readier for school .
and she undresseded .
she put her pajamas on her pillow .
and she put on her shoes .
but her tie laces broke .
and then she ate her breakfast .
and the bus came and got her .
and then she came back from school .
the end .
they walked over when they saw .
they walked over when they saw something in the sky with aliens .
and then +/.

so they wanted to go see them .
but the boy didn't .
and the girl did .
so the girl pulled his hand .
and they were walking over to them .
and a mom and a dad and and the daughter with a dog .
the end .
