tuesday morning Lisa and john and their mother went out .
they they were at school .
and when their mom picked them up they went home .
and so their mom told them that tonight they were going to go out to eat at Mcdonalds .
and the little girl's name was Lisa .
and the boy's name was john .
and john ordered a happy meal with a vanilla shake .
and Lisa ordered a a happy meal with a coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
and and the mom forgot her purse .
um that's all I remember .
one day a little boy woke up .
and he was late for school .
and he was very tired .
when he got up to his breakfast he accidentally spilled his milk .
when he put on his shoes one of his shoelaces snapped .
and he was late for the bus .
so he hadta walk to school .
when he got up to school his teacher was disappointed .
he he was not on time .
that's all .
one day a ship came down from outer space .
and some octopuses were on it .
and they came off board .
and they said what a lovely day .
I think we should run around and go to the play center .
when some kids saw them they cried eek@c .
the boy did eek@c .
and the girl said yeah let's go see them !
and when they saw them the octopuses were scared .
so they went back on the ship and went back to outer space .
that's all .
