one night Raymond and Lisa's mom asked them where they wanted to go out tonight .
they yelled Mcdonalds .
and so they went out .
and Lisa didn't know what she wanted .
but Raymond and her mom did .
and then she finally knew what she wanted .

and the clerk said it would be twelve twelve something .
and the clerk said that will be yeah I already said that part +...
the mom looked in the purse .
and she left the money on the counter at home .
one day this boy woke up .
and he looked at the time .
and he woke up late .
and then when he got up he ran out of bed got some cereal but spilled the milk .
and he was looking at the time when he spilled the milk .
then when he was tying the shoe he broke part of the shoestring .
then he finally got his things packed and got outside .
the school bus was already leaving .

and the teacher either it's the principal or the teacher and she said he was late .
it looks like these kids were playing .
and the boy didn't wanna go where the aliens were because he saw these aliens .
so he didn't wanna go where she was taking him .
but she kept on .
and then there were aliens out in the park with a strange looking dog .
and there was a spaceship right there .
and the mom was wearing a dress .
looks like with eight legs or at least ten .
and the child was bald .
the dad was bald .
but the mother wasn't .
and there's another alien inside the spaceship that looks like the driver .
and the boy he was trying to get her off of them so they wouldn't go down there .
she thought it was a cool idea to go down there .
but the boy was stopping her trying not to go anywhere .
but it looks like they actually did get somewhere .
