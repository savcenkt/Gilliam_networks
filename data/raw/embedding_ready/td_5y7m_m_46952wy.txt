I forgot the first part .
I remember the Mcdonalds part .
they couldn't get their food because their mom didn't have her purse .
and they went to Wendys .
hm: I remember the Mcdonalds part .
I'm thinking .
I think that is all I know .
once Ash got up from his nap .
and his Pikachu was gone .
so it dot took him by Team_Rocket .
and he went to go get it with his best buddies Brock and Misty .
and he hadta fight them with his Pokemon .
and he also had a Gengar which is ninety hit points .
and it was a diffuse type .
so he went to find Team_Rocket with his Pidgeotto .
that's the end of the story .
once some persons went to the some place .
and there was some aliens going into the spaceship .
and there was this table dog .
and one girl want go with those guys .
and the other guy said no you can't .
they're going to outer space .
