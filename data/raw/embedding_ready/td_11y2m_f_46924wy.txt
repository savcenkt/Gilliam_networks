one day when Raymond and Lisa got home from school they went inside .
and they talked to their mom .
and she said that they were gonna go out for dinner .
and she asked them what they wanted .
and they both said Mcdonalds .
and so they got in the car .
and they went to Mcdonalds .
Lisa didn't know what she wanted .
she either wanted a Big_Mac or a Kids_Happy_Meal .
and when the person came onto the speaker phone Raymond ordered a cheeseburger with a vanilla shake .
and their mom ordered a salad .
Lisa finally knew what she wanted .
so she said to the clerk I want a kidsmeal cheeseburger with a chocolate icecream cone .
and they said that the total was twelve dollars and fifty cents .
when it was time to pay their mother forgot that she had left the money at home .
