Lisa and Raymond's mom said we're eating out tonight .
and where do you wanna go ?
Lisa and Raymond both shouted Mcdonalds .
and when they got there Lisa couldn't decide what she wanted between the happy meal or a Big_Mac .
Raymond and her mom had already decided what they wanted .
Raymond ordered a Big_Mac with a chocolate shake .
and their mom ordered a salad .
Lisa finally made up her mind about what she wanted .
and she told the clerk a happy meal a coke and a chocolate shake .
and the clerk said that'll be twelve dollars .
when their mom went to reach for her purse it wasn't there .
and she realized she had left it on the kitchen counter .
what should they do ?
Raymond woke up .
and he was very tired .
then when it was time for breakfast he looked at the clock and knew he was really late for school .
and he was so tired he spilled milk all over the table .
and when he got dressed and put his shoes on his shoelace broke .
and when he went outside with his backpack +...
and he tried to run after the bus because he missed it .
and then he he supposedly walked to school .
and his teacher was standing outside the door pointing at her watch which meant you're late .
Raymond and Julie found a trail and followed it .
when they gotta the end of the trail there was a spaceship that was yellow orange and red .
they waited for awhile .
and when the door opened this family came out .
but it wasn't a regular family .
they were aliens .
and Julie wanted to go talk to them .
but Raymond said no .
I don't think that's a good idea .
and after that Raymond pulled Julie to the trail and went back up it .
and they never saw the aliens again .
uhuh .
