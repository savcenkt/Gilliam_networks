one morning two teenagers went to the park to to explore for a bug hunt .
and when they got there something landed on the ground .
and a little door opened .
and aliens came out with a pet donkey .
Richard said he was scared .
he made a scared face .
Michelle saw that they were pretty nice .
she went over to see them .
when the aliens got out they looked like they were heading straight for Richard .
and there were a few more people who were coming .
they had suitcases with them too .
they looked like aliens with purple dots on them .
