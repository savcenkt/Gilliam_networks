mom asked where do you wanna go to eat ?
and the children both said Mcdonalds .
so they jumped into the car .
and mom drove to Mcdonalds .
and when they got there Lisa wanted a Happy_Meal and a drink .
and her brother wanted a milkshake , a cheeseburger , and french fries .
and mom wanted a salad .
but when they realized how much it cost mom forgot her purse at home .
the boy woke up late this morning and got out of bed and started to get dressed as fast as he can .
and after he got out of bed he went to go eat breakfast fast .
and then after breakfast he got dressed .
and after that he tried to catch up with the school bus .
but it was just leaving .
and he tried .
and he just hadta walk to school .
and then when he showed up at school the principal was showing him that he is late .
once there were two children who went to the park and saw aliens coming out of the ship .
Lisa thought it could be friends .
so she grabbed David and said come on David .
let's go see who they are .
but David didn't wanna go .
he thought it was dangerous .
and one of the monsters was waving .
and Ashley wanted to wave back to one of them .
and and they look like they are going to stay said David .
but but I don't wanna go anyway .
so they ran back to their mom and dad and told them about the aliens who were coming to earth .
