she wanted to go meet them and say hi .
but the brother said no wait stop !
but she grabbed him already .
and they went out of the bushes .
they saw them .
the aliens were very shy to see people that weren't very familiar .
they told them what happened .
you have landed on earth in the woods .

they said sure .
but the brother said no .
