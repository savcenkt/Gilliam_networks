they wanted to eat at Mcdonalds .
and the mom got her purse .
and that all .
okay .
he woke up .
and then he he ate some cereal .
and then he tied his shoe .
and he broke it .
and he missed the bus .
and then he hadta walk to school .
once upon a time a little octopuses walking down to sit on their bench .
and these two were afraid because they saw it .
and and her didn't be afraid because her liked the octopuses .
and he doesn't because she doesn't want her to get all poisonous on him because under a octopuses them have little tactac@o things in there .
and them could put you poisonous on you .
that's the end .
