.
they went to Mcdonalds .
and they ordered a cheeseburger and a happy meal .
and the mom ordered a salad .
but she forgot her purse .
that's all I can remember .
the boy wakes up .
and he has breakfast .
and he spilled his breakfast .
and he's trying to tie his shoes except he broke his shoelace .
and he missed the bus .
and +...
I forgot the rest .
the ship landed .
and all the aliens came out .
and the little girl or the teenager she went out dragging her father .
