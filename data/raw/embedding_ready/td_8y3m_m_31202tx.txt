when Lisa and Raymond got home from school their mom asked them tonight we're going out to eat .
where would you like to eat ?
they both shouted Mcdonalds .
so that night she drove them to Mcdonalds .
and they they ordered the food .
and Raymond said that he would have a cheeseburger some french fries a coke and a milkshake .
their mom said that he would have a salad .
and Lisa said that she would have a happy meal with coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
and then the person said that'll be twelve dollars and fifty cents .
and then their mom reached for the purse .
then she she discovered that it wasn't there .
it was in their house on the kitchen counter .
one morning Tom woke up .
and he figured out his alarm clock was running late .
and he quickly poured a snack .
and he wasn't paying attention .
and he spilled the milk .
and he was in such a rush that one of his shoelaces came off .
then he just ran for the school bus .
and when he gotta school he was tardy .
one time there there were two kids at the park playing .
and then they saw an alien ship landing .
and then aliens came outside with with a mom a dad a child and a dog .
and then the girl wanted to get closer to them .
but then the boy held her back and telling her not to .
and that's it .
