they ended up not eating .
I don't think I can remember much .
I just don't know where to start from .
they were going to Mcdonalds .
and Lisa ordered a happy meal .
and I can't remember the other girl's name and the other boy's name .
and the little boy ordered a cheeseburger I think .
and she ordered a strawberry milkshake .
but it cost twelve dollars and fifty cents .
but her mother forgot her purse .
one day the little boy woke up .
and he didn't feel well .
he tried to pour his breakfast .
but it made a mess .
then he went to get dressed .
but when he tried to tie his shoes the shoestrings broke .
when he tried to go to school on the school bus he missed the bus because he wasn't feeling well .
and then when he gotta school he was very late .
one day these two kids went out to play at the park .
but there was a big spaceship with aliens .
and they all walked out to move to where all the humans were .
but the kids were scared to go near them because they thought they were mean .
and they would hurt them .
but then they went back to tell their mother that they saw aliens moving into earth .
and then their parents got scared because they thought they would hurt all the children .
but when they moved in they were nice to everyone .
and they went to school with everyone .
