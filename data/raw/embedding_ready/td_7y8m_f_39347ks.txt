how does it start out again ?
at home .
and their mother said where do you wanna eat tonight .
and they said Mcdonalds Mcdonalds .
and so they went to Mcdonalds .
and Lisa didn't know what to order a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
and Raymond ordered a ah hm: I forgot .
and their mom ordered a salad .
and Lisa ordered a happy meal with a chocolate icecream cone and a shake .
and then they said that would be twelve dollars and four cents .
and when she reached for her purse it wasn't there .
once upon a time there was a boy .
he woke up one morning .
and he was having a bad day .
when he tried to pour himself some cereal he was looking at the clock so he spilled the milk .
then when he tied his shoes the laces snapped out .
and he missed the bus .
so he hadta run after it really really fast .
and once he gotta school he was really late .
once upon a time there was a girl and a boy .
and they went to the park .
and they saw little flying saucer or spaceship there .
and the boy was scared so he started yelling .
then she said wait come back .
and they saw aliens walking out a dad a mom and a little kid with a dog .
and they saw even another person still in the spaceship .
so she said look at those guys .
they're aliens .
and then he said yeah I see them .
now can we go now ?
and she said no let's go talk to them .
but he said no I I'd rather stay here .
so they went back to the house .
and they told their mom and dad .
and they didn't believe them that much though .
they took them there .
and they saw those aliens .
so then they both started to believe them .
