yeah .
the girl and the boy got home from school .
their mom said what do you want for dinner ?
and the girl and the boy said Mcdonalds .
they took them to Mcdonalds .
and they went to the counter .
and their mom ordered a salad .
the girl ordered chocolate icecream cone .
and I think the boy ordered a hamburger .
and then they were gonna pay for it .
but they just remembered that they left the purse at home .
he woke up late .
he poured his breakfast .
and he made a mess .
he was tying his shoes .
and his shoelace snapped .
and he was mad because he missed the bus .
and his teacher got mad because he was late .
