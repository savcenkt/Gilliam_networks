the mom said tomorrow we're going to Mcdonalds .
the boy and girl said Mcdonalds .
and they got in the car .
they drive to Mcdonalds .
they went 0to the counter and said +...
the sister said +...
I can't remember that one part .
she's having 0a hamburger cheese .
the brother 0is having a hamburger .
the mother 0is having a salad .
Mcdonald_guy said that'd be twenty five cents .
she got her wallet .
she didn't have twenty five cent .
she left it in the kitchen on the counter .
the boy wake up because the bell 0was ringing up .
and he spill the milk on the table .
he broke his thing off his shoe .
the school bus left him .
at the end he walks to school .
the teacher said you are late .
in the morning the alien come to live here .
and 0I think they walk to the grass .
they saw real aliens .
the alien walk to find a house .
they have a pet .
they have a family .
and and the boy was scared .
the girl 0was happy .
the girl was trying to go closer .
but the girl hold his hand to go over there .
and everybody try not to say no .
the girl said let's go to see the aliens .
the alien come out .
they left .
this is it .
the alien mom was happy and the brother too .
0I think 0the dog was happy .
they were waving .
and &=sighs +...
