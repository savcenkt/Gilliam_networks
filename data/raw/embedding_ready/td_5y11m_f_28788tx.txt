eighteen one day +...
they went to Mcdonalds .
they went to Mcdonalds .
and the boy ordered a cheeseburger .
and the mom ordered a salad .
and the little girl ordered chocolate icecream cone .
the mother forgot her purse at home .
and that's about all I remember .
one day a little boy discovered that his alarm clock was ringing .
he hurried and got out of bed .
and he he poured too much milk into his cereal .
then his shoelace broke off of his shoe .
then he missed the bus .
and then he was late for school .
the end .
once upon a time there was a little girl and boy .
they were walking to the park .
suddenly a big flying saucer dropped on the park .
and an alien family started coming out .
the little girl was very surprised .
she wanted to meet the alien family .
but her brother said it was a bad idea .
then the alien family's dog started barking at them .
she was very scared and ran past her brother all the way home .
the end .
