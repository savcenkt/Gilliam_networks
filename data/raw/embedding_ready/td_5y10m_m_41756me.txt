one day Raymond and Lisa came home .
their mother said we're going out to eat .
where do you wanna go ?
Mcdonalds .
then they hoped into the car .
then the mother drove to the nearest Mcdonalds .
then when they got there Raymond ordered a milkshake &*INV:uhhuh and (9.) I forgot +...
their mother ordered salads .
and Lisa ordered some chocolate icecream .
eight and that's all I can remember .
they didn't have enough enough money to get the sister's food .
one day boy woke up .
and he came down the stairs .
then he tried to make breakfast by hisself .
but then he got an accident .
then when he was getting to school he was late .
and he was so late that he broke his shoelace .
he was so late that he missed the bus .
he asked his mom to take him to school .
and she said yes .
no .
once there was a place .
and then some people came .
but a flying saucer landed .
one of them wanted some action .
and the other one was too scared .
aliens came out with an alien dog .
the alien dog looked scarier than the aliens .
but the aliens didn't see the people .
then they saw place where they can start to live .
but the people they like to go there everyday .
so the aliens stole their place .
the aliens didn't even know about the people .
they said to each other how could we get there with all those aliens there .
they said I don't know .
then come on let's see and figure out a way .
oh no I won't go the boy said .
but the girl said yeah let's go .
it's too dangerous .
aww@c come on don't be scared .
so they tried to figure out a way how to get there .
but once they came up with a plan .
if we do something first and make something to get them then we could have our spot back they said .
so they tried their idea .
their idea worked .
and they lived happily ever after .
