she forgot her purse .
and they went to Mcdonalds for dinner .
and then they went there .
the little girl ordered a salad .
the little boy +...
I forgot .
the mom ordered a salad .
I forgot what he ordered .
and then she ordered +...
I can't remember .
she ordered a Happy_Kids_Meal .
then she reached for her purse .
and it wasn't there .
it was at home .
she realized that it was at home on the kitchen counter .
the boy wakes up .
he pours his cereal makes a mess .
then he tries to tie his shoes .
they break .
he chases after the school bus .
and then he's late .
and he tells his teacher why .
he doesn't wanna go over there because they see alien ship .
and then the aliens come out .
they look friendly .
but the boy's too afraid to go .
and it kinda looks like his sister wants to because she wants to meet them .
but they could be dangerous .
so it looks like they don't go .
