I have a short span memory .
one day when Lisa and Raymond got home their mom said they were going out to eat .
and she asked where they wanted to eat .
and Lisa and Raymond both yelled Mcdonalds .
so their mom drove them to the nearest Mcdonalds .
and Lisa couldn't make up her mind whether to get a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
Raymond and their mother both knew what they wanted .
when they went up to the counter Raymond ordered a cheeseburger french fries and a vanilla milkshake .
their mom ordered a salad .
Lisa finally made up her mind and got a happy meal a coke and a chocolate icecream cone .
then the cashier said it was twelve dollars and some cents .
and then their mom just realized that she had left her purse at home on the counter .
what should they do ?
there was this one boy that got up late made breakfast and made a mess and then hadta clean it up but that took more time than he thought .
then his shoelaces broke .
and he had a lot of time hadta find a new lace .
and then when he got outside the bus was just leaving while he got out .
and then he hadta walk to school .
and the principal was waiting outside for him and telling him he was late .
once there was this alien family .
they wanted to come to earth for a vacation .
so they did .
when they got there two kids behind a bush saw them .
and one of them wanted to go see them .
but the other one wouldn't let her .
and so they ended up not going .
and the alien family had a father a mother a daughter and a dog .
and instead of coming in an airplane they came in a spaceship .
and when one of the kids convinced the other one it was a bad idea they went home and didn't go back .
