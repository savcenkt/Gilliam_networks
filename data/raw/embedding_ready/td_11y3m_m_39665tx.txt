they ordered their food .
and then it was twelve fifty .
and they forgot the purse at home .
the end .
and they ate at Mcdonalds .
he's having a really bad day .
he wakes up .
and he's late for school .
when he tries pouring milk for his cereal it starts spilling out because he's looking at the clock .
when he tries to tie his shoe it shoelace comes off .
it snaps off .
and then the bus leaves without him .
so he hasta run to school .
and then the principal's taping her watch saying he's late .
once upon a time there was a boy and a girl who were walking to a park .
the girl was very interested in aliens .
then when they were just about to reach the park they heard the sound of air pushing up .
when they peered out from behind a bush they saw a family of aliens and a big spaceship with letters they cannot read coming out .
the father was carrying bags .
the mother was holding a child's hand who held their dog named spark .
and as they walk out the girl wanted to run over and talk to the aliens .
her friend held her back and said that they shouldn't go over to the aliens because they might hurt us .
but she shoved him away and went out .
then the aliens abducted her .
and took out her brains .
and the boy tried to stop them .
but that same thing happened to them .
and then the aliens left back to mars .
the end .
