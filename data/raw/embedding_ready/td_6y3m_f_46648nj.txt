there was a young girl and boy that went to um let's see +...
and and one of them was named Henry .
and one of them was named Lisa .
and the mother said do you wanna go out for dinner .
and where do you wanna go ?
and they said Mcdonalds .
so they went to Mcdonalds .
and Lisa didn't know what she she wanna eat .
Henry got cheeseburger and a vanilla milkshake .
and their mother got salad .
and now Lisa knowed what she wanted a happy meal with a chocolate icecream cone .
and she said to the man at the counter .
and the man at the counter said that will be fifteen cents .
and the problem was that the mother left her purse at home on the counter .
so I think they should go back and get it .
because you hafta think before you do it .
once upon time there was a boy .
he went to sleep .
and when he waked up it was time for school .
and he spilled his milk .
and his shoelace came off .
and he missed his bus .
his teacher said you're really late for school now .
Daniel and Shirley were were walking to the park .
and then he saw a big ship .
and aliens came out ahh@c .
and so Shirley wanted to go say hi .
but but Daniel didn't let her .
he said no I say that aliens are are not nice .
they'll cook you up and eat you ahh@c .
the end .
