and the kid looked at the clock .
and he was almost late for school and the school bus .
he tried to tie his shoe .
but he broke the stringlace .
he went and tried to get the bus to stop .
and and the teacher said he was late .
there was a spaceship coming to earth .
and the girl and a boy thought that those were aliens .
and the aliens went somewhere .
and a girl and a boy saw aliens .
