I don't think I remember any of it .
okay I can't remember how it started .
but there were two kids .
they wanted to go out for dinner .
their mother asked them where they wanted to go .
and they both said Mcdonalds .
and so they went to Mcdonalds .
and the boy ordered a vanilla milkshake a hamburger and I forget what else .
the mom ordered a salad .
and the girl ordered a chocolate icecream cone a coke and a happy meal .
but it was twelve dollars and something cents .
but then they couldn't get it because their mother had forgot their purse at home .
what I would call this story is a very bad day .
he woke up .
his alarm clock was too loud .
it hurt his ears .
secondly he spilled his milk when he was pouring his cereal .
when he was tying his shoe he broke a shoelace .
he missed the bus .
and he was late for school .
it looks like eight thirty in this picture .
two friends went to play at the park .
but then one of them saw something .
he pulled the other one down behind a bush .
and he said look over there .
and then they looked .
it was a big spaceship with aliens .
the end .
