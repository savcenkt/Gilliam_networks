Danielle said let's go greet them .
and Daniel was older .
and he said no .
Danielle said come on .
so they went to greet them .
and the octopuses talked a different language .
and so did the dog .
it didn't go woof woof .
then why did they have those suitcaseses [: suitcases] [* m:+s] in the same xxx .
maybe they were the same xxx .
maybe they would think xxx xxx .
when they left they left their dog .
and then they came back down .
and and the dog was still there .
they took the dog and suddenly went away .
Daniel and Danielle were <> having a good time at the park .
yeah .
their mom said where you wanna eat out .
and they said Mcdonalds .
and when they ordered their food their mom left her money at home .
his mom told him it's time to get up and brush your teeth and go to school .
and he brushed his teeth and put on his shoes and went to school .
then after the bus picked him up he said to his teacher is school ready .
this girl and boy was gonna go somewhere .
and these three were xxx where are they going ?
but these two didn't know them actually .
but little bit .
and these two wanted to go check it out .
but they think they might get away .
aliens .
a alien ship .
yeah .
they probably might go up the trees .
probably him or her .
or go over here to sit down .
um when when .
is it Randy ?
is the boy named Randy ?
when Randy and Lisa came home their mother said today we're going out to eat .
and where do you wanna go to eat out ?
Mcdonalds they all shouted .
and they jumped into the car and rode to the nearest Mcdonalds .
Ryan he ordered a vanilla milkshake with a cheeseburger and fries and a coke .
and Lisa finally made up her mind by getting a happy meal and a chocolate ice cream cone with a coke .
<> when she told the clerk that he said it was twelve dollars .
except for one problem .
mother reached into her purse and found that it wasn't there .
that she had left it on the kitchen counter at home .
once upon a time there was a boy named +...
this goes with this picture .
there was a boy named Allen .
he was sleeping so long that he was late for school .
this is not the picture yet .
he got quickly dressed .
but he missed the bus because he was so slow .
he gotta school very late .
and his teacher told him next time to catch the bus .
in gym he he sat down to tie his shoe .
but one of his shoelaces ripped off .
and he was really having a bad day .
when he came home he decided to put on his pajamas and decided to have a snack like cereal since there was nothing else to eat in the house .
and he worried about the clock about when mom was going to get home .
what would he tell her ?
once upon a time a little girl and a little boy went to the park .
the little girl Sumie saw some purple blue spotted people .
she thought they were might fun to play with .
look at that one holding the dog she said .
that one it looks like maybe I can play with it she said .
but the boy grabbed her .
or the girl grabbed his hand .
and she said come on .
let's go play with the doggy and the little person .
but the boy said I don't know .
they could be from somewhere we don't know .
and quite now the boy was right .
it was a space alien ship that landed down .
it looked like some aliens were moving to this park .
one was a father alien coming out holding stuff .
looks like they were going to move here .
and another was a mother alien who came down with a child .
the child had had a little alien pet dog .
it seemed like that the boy was right .
come on sis he said .
let's get out of here .
I think we might be imagining this .
but I wanna play with the doggy said the little girl .
but it was too late .
the boy had already grabbed her hand and took her <> all the way home .

then he hadta redo his cereal and ate it and got dressed as fast as he could .
then when he hadta sit at the busstop his shoelace got broken .
he hadta go back inside get some tape tape it all the way back together .
then the school bus passed .
he ran and ran for it until he finally gotta school .
the teacher was furious at what time it was and how late he had gotten to school .
he told her the whole bare facts .
and then his teacher said well it's not your fault .
guess it was just a bad day .
the end .
[<] that's it .
once there were two kids named Tom and Jamie .
one day they were walking , siting on a bench in the park .
then they heard something behind the bushes .
they went over to see what it was .
it was a family of human hungry aliens .
Jamie wanted to see what they would do .
but you see Tom told Jamie not to go over there .
but Jamie grabbed Tom's hand .
the aliens almost saw them .
but Jamie thought it was a better idea what Tom had .
they went to their parents and told them the bare facts .
they went back but the alien ship was gone .
so then to this day the parents and the kids don't know what went on that day if it was just an illusion or if it was real .
Lisa and Raymond's mom asked them where they wanted to eat .
and they both chanted out Mcdonalds .
so then they went there .
Lisa couldn't decide what she wanted a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
um what's that kids name ?
Raymond was it ?
Raymond and his mom knew what they wanted .
Raymond wanted a vanilla shake and a shoot I forgot what they ordered to drink +...
well I forgot what he was gonna +...
his mom wanted salad .
and Lisa she said to the clerk and said I'll have a happy meal happy meal with a coke to drink and a chocolate icecream cone .
it all <> totaled up to twelve fifty .
but they forgot the money at home .
I didn't tell it correct .
[<] I forgot they looked for the purse .
and then it wasn't there .
once there was a kid name Andrew .
he woke up late for bed .
and he felt dizzy because his alarm clock didn't go off .
and then he was distracted at the clock .
when he was pouring his milk he spilled all over .
when he was tying his shoes the shoelace snapped .
and when he went to school he missed the bus .
so he hadta walk there for ten miles .
and mud splashed on him just a bit .
and then when he went to school his teacher told him that he was tardy .
so he got a tardy slip .
and he went to detention <> for ten hours .
on February nineteenth two thousand and two aliens abducted the planet .
and two kids named Andrew and Michelle saw them .
Michelle wanted to um +...
and they saw their weird alien dog .
<> and she wanted to go pet him .
but Andrew didn't let her go .
and then they went .
and then they saw another one coming out .
and so then they went home to tell their parents that they saw aliens .
they went back after that .
and the aliens weren't there .
neither was the ship .
and the aliens turned out to be their parents because the aliens already abducted the parents .
so then +...
but it wasn't really aliens .
it was just their parents .
and their sister dressed up like them in a costume just kidding .
that was bad .
hm: .
and then two years later real aliens came and abducted them .
Lisa and Raymond got home from school .
and their mother came home .
their mother asked them that they were going out to eat .
she asked them where they wanted to go out to eat .
they said Mcdonalds .
they jumped in the car .
and their mom drove them to the nearest Mcdonalds .
Lisa couldn't make up her mind whether she wanted to get a Big_Mac or a happy meal .
her mom ordered a salad .
Raymond ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a medium vanilla milkshake .
Lisa finally made up her mind that she wanted a happy meal .
she told the clerk that she would have a happy meal with fries and a strawberry vanilla icecream cone .
the clerk said that it will be twelve dollars and eighty nine cents .
when Lisa and Raymond's mother reached into her purse it was not there .
she just remembered that she had left her purse at home .
what should they do ?
a boy wakes up and looks at the clock and says oh no I'm gonna be late for school .
he goes downstairs and gets cereal ready .
but he makes a big mess because all the time he's watching the clock .
when he's tying his shoes to get ready for school he accidently tears off one of the shoelaces .
when he finally gets his shoelaces tied and goes outside for the school bus the school bus is leaving without him .
when he finally gets to school after a long and tiring walk his teacher points to her watch and says you're late .
and so he walks inside and gets ready .
the end .
a boy and a girl go to the park and have a picnic .
<> a few minutes later they see an alien spaceship landing there and then taking off .
they scream and are trying to run away when <> they find a family of aliens that come out of the ship .
the girl wants to go over there to meet them .
but the boy says no .

let's see if I can remember my story .
one day there was a boy and a girl playing tag in the park .
the boy was it .
and the girl was running from him .
just then an alien spaceship landed on the earth .
an alien family came out and talked a language they did not know .
after about a week the aliens decided to go back home .
the girl wanted to touch them .
but the boy wouldn't let her .
when they left they forgot their pets .
so the next day they came back and took their pet with them .
then they flew off into space again .
and lived happily ever after on their own planet .
they came home from school .
[<] their mom said that they were gonna go out to eat .
mhm .
and she said where do you wanna go ?
and Lisa and Raymond shouted out Mcdonalds .
and then their mom drove to Mcdonalds .
and then they got inside .
[<] they were walking inside .
and then they got inside .
Raymond knew what he wanted to eat .
and his mom knew what she wanted to eat .
and then +...
but Lisa didn't know what to order .
[<] thought and thought about it .
and then she ordered &*INV:mhm a happy meal a chocolate icecream &*INV:mhm and a chocolate milkshake and a happy meal .
and the clerk said it would be twelve fifty .
and (7.) +...
and then she reached down to her purse .
and she couldn't find it .
and then she realized she left it at home on the counter .
this guy's name is gonna be Ron .
[<] .
Ron &*INV:mhm woke up one morning .
at +...
Ron was asleep um xxx xxx .
Ron woke up .
and he figured out that he overslept when his alarm went .
next he went downstairs and poured his cereal .
but he wasn't looking at his thing when he was doing the cereal .
he looked at the clock .
then he spilled almost all of the milk that he had poured in the bowl .
and then he hadta clean it up .
next he went upstairs and got dressed .
[>] then <> he started to tie his shoe .
he was tying his shoe when all of a sudden the string broke .
and then he hadta tie it with a little tiny weeny string .
and then he was all ready to go .
and then he missed the bus .
so he hadta walk all the way to school .
and then when he gotta school he saw his teacher outside .
and he was tardy .
so Ron was really having a bad day .
the boy's name is gonna be David .
the girl's name is gonna be lily .
lily not xxx .
David and lily were walking in the park .
and they saw a big saucer coming .
um I forgot his name already .
&*INV:mhm David said look at that saucer .
so lily look at that saucer .
they thought it could be a big meteorite instead .
it started slowing down when it came to the earth .
then it came down and landed on the earth .
and then a door came flying down .
then David and lily knew that it was an alien <> saucer .
so then they went and hid behind some brushy bushes and <> peered over the top .
and and they saw the door open .
and then they saw these little figures coming out .
they saw one leg two leg three legs four legs five legs <> lots of legs coming out of the things .
they knew that it would be alien .
so the aliens +...
so they hid because they have all these little dots over them .
and they look like chickenpox .
and they had this weird dog an alien dog .
and then they land .
and then lily started to run over to try to meet them .
but but David said no wait they could hurt us .
they're not from our land .
they're from mars I think or from another galaxy .
so +...
but lily didn't pay any attention .
she just kept on trying to meet them .
and then lily finally listened .
she didn't go to meet them because they looked weird .
but they had nice smiles .
so then they went home .
and so the next day they came back .
and the aliens also were still there .
and so they wondered why it would stay here .
and they wondered where the aliens were .
and they looked all around .
and then they finally saw that they were eating the picnic .
and then they they watched them go and play on the playground .
and then they fell asleep .
so Elaina and David <> looked in the alien saucer .
looked like nothing was there .
except on the other side there was probably something .
they went in and looked on the other side .
they saw that there was nothing .
and they saw this big red button .
and then they saw all these weird curves on the side .
so they knew that at last they hadta push the red button for the stuff like the chair to be and the guns and all the other stuff .
<> and so that they now roll why that's where all the stuff went .
so now they know that they're hiding it because they don't want anybody to take off in their ship while they're still here .
so that's why they hid it .
so then right when they got out they hid in the bushes again .
then they were starting to wake up .
and then they went back on their alien saucer and went back and got some drinks .
and and then they came back out .
and there they saw the weird dog again .
and there was many many many legs and those green spots on their faces .
and then Elaina jumped up from behind the brush and started to run towards the aliens again .
but David said no no no no wait wait .
we don't know any of them .
and Elaina didn't pay any attention .
so she just kept on trying to meet them .
and then David pulled her back .
and she fell on her bottom .
so did David .
and then they went over and had a picnic .
and then they went back into the playground .
and they took a nap .
and they keeps on going over and over again .
and that's all .
one day Raymond and Lisa's mom came to pick them up in school .

but it was landed .
someone was waving goodbye from the saucer .
Shane wanted to hide behind the bush and sneak away home .
but Michelle said oh how bad can these aliens be .
they have two arms and just a couple more legs than we do .
a couple more Shane said .
about lets just say fifty more .
and she's like oh come on Shane .
she grabbed Shane .
and they went .
the aliens had the squeaky voice .
the same voice she heard that that said this was Michelle , Sarah's friend .
so Sarah said where's my friend Michelle .
they pointed to a little girl .
that's not my friend Michelle unless you're in your halloween costume because halloween's not until next month .
well , no no I'm your friend Michelle .
I've been watching you .
all those phone calls you got that I have been talking to you .
those weren't from any of your friend Michelle .
that wasn't from your friend Michelle that's here on earth with you .
that was from me .
and I'm like I have a friend alien ?
I don't think so .
I haven't even met you before .
Sarah screamed .
the alien put their hand over it .
don't worry .
we won't hurt you .
we come in peace .
and then she said what are you doing here ?
well we hear your family has some problems .
and she's like no , no problems in a mysterious way .
well said Michelle the alien then how come you're so sad and always cry in the bathroom .
I don't do that Michelle said .
David started laughing .
Sarah told David to be quiet .
she's talking to this alien .
so David was quiet .
and he's like well that's not even true .
Sarah's standing there and she's like yes it is .
you're sad because your aunt might die .
she's like well she might .
but I wasn't crying in the bathroom .
I'm not trying to embarrass you .
it's natural to cry .
and she's like you're an alien .
how do you know anything ?
she's like aliens have feelings too .
suddenly Sarah noticed a little llama llama but dog type animal .
said what in the world is that thing that you're holding with a leash ?
oh this is my pet <> Grucchi she said .
Grucchi , what type of animal is that ?
it's a <> dogape@n .
a dogape@n ?
what's a dogape@n ?
it's a dogape@n .
it's a pet .
Sarah's very confused .
now she was thinking this can't be true .
so she grabbed their head .
but nothing came off except a speck of skin .
Sarah was <> very scared now .
the saucer was gone .
and they put all their luggage down .
are you moving here she said nervously ?
of course we are .
we like it down in here on earth .
we wanna <> meet some of you earthlings .
but but we're different than you .
we only have two legs .
and we don't have dogapes@n .
we have dogs .
and she's like oh I won't hurt you .
we both have two arms , five fingers and one head .
I'm sure we'll be fine together .
we could be best friends .
<> suddenly Sarah said where's my friend Michelle ?
(2.) Michelle she's at her house watching tv .
well that's what she was doing when I got into the saucer .
well I'm leaving .
and she's like don't leave yet .
we wanna come with you .
<> she's like never .
so David and <> Sarah ran home .
they told their parents .
their parents said oh it's probably just some crazy person dressing up .
but but I tried to grab their head off and only skin came off Sarah said nervously and sort of angry that her parents wouldn't believe her .
come here and I'll show you .
when they got back there the aliens were gone .
they went to every house in the neighborhood .
and finally at Michelle's house there were the aliens .
well Michelle her friend's house .
but Michelle the alien lived there too .
and her family was there .
but she didn't have her brother for David to play with .
she said she <> remembered what she said .
why did I hafta bring David ?
you don't have a brother .
xxx of course I do Grucchi .
my dogape@n is my brother .
David shouted well I'm never gonna be friends with a dogape@n .
I'm never gonna be friends with any alien or alien pet .
and they're like but why are you at Michelle's house ?
oh because we knew this this was the only place you would go .
their parents were now with them .
their parents , Michelle , David were all shocked in <> terror .
they couldn't get rid of these aliens .
suddenly the the aliens took off their skin .
and they were regular people .
in fact they were Michelle's cousins .
Sarah had met them before but just once .
and she's like you're regular people ?
then how come when I tried to take off our skin .
these aren't special things .
we got them at the costume store in California where we live .
here up in Ohio they don't have any good costumes .
and what about that dogape@n thing ?
oh this is just mechanical .
what about the saucer ?
I work at a space space thing .
then how come the saucer wasn't there anymore ?
it has wheels .
it it didn't seem very clear to Sarah .
but I guess she hadta believe it .
she didn't know if she wanted to believe it .
but she tried .
she went home wondering .
she never really did ever believe in aliens until now at least .
she wondered if there really was such thing as aliens .
and they were really alien in a costume as a human .
that night Sarah couldn't go to sleep .
finally she went to sleep .
but she never forgot that day with the aliens .

one day , Dana and Hugo [% child laughs] were walking .

and a family of squidlike aliens emerged .
with them was this odd looking thing of supposedly their impression of a dog .

he'd been reading too many science fiction books .
so he thought they had like alien zapper guns or something .
and anyway a squid family had a picnic lunch too .
they walked over to the bench .
and they sat down .
now this got Hugo rather mad because he really wanted a lunch because Dana was his girlfriend .
and it's the whole thing anyway .
and so they just decided to go up and see if they could get their bench back .
but instead , they ended up becoming rather good friends with the aliens .
they even got some photos .
mhm .

&=sighs Hugo , for example , got a book and a and a squidish@n to to english dictionary &=laughs .
