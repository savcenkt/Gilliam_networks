the girl was tryin(g) to go to them .
the brother said no .
the girl was tryin(g) to to pull his hand .
the boy had said no .
I can't think of anymore .
on thursday they wanted to go to Mcdonalds .
and they couldn't figure out what they were gonna order .
the boy and his mom they said that they knew what they wanted to eat .
Lisa couldn't figure out what he [% ew:she] wanted .
I mean Lisa she didn't figure out what she wanted .
